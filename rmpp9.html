                    							<h2>Summary Post</h2>

<p>Recent history is strewn with examples of companies manipulating scientific research for their own benefit. In my initial post, I called attention to the flaws in Ancel Keys’ Seven Countries Study (Wood, 2023). Keys’ research, and others like it, were used by the Sugar Research Foundation to downplay the harm posed by sugar consumption, and to influence government policy towards promoting a low-fat, high cholesterol diet (‌Kearns et al., 2016). The outcome of this policy has been a significant increase in the rates of obesity and diabetes, largely linked to the ever growing consumption of sugar (Johnson et al., 2017).</p>

<p>In their response, Wang Wang (2023) pointed out two additional, albeit non-nutrition-related, cases. The first was the unethical use of research by tobacco companies to minimize the risks associated with smoking. The second was from the oil and gas industry, where again research was misused to cast doubts on the role of carbon dioxide emissions in climate change.</p>

<p>The cases of sugar, tobacco, and oil all demonstrate that where enormous sums of money are involved, research and researchers are susceptible to corruption (Rucker & Rucker, 2016). Recent studies have shown that alcohol consumption is a significant risk factor for many types of cancer (Klein et al., 2020). Will it soon come to light that major distillers have known this for decades but used unethical research to deflect attention away? </p>

<p>If researchers can be bought, the solution to this problem may not lie in ever more stringent ethical guidelines. The response from Gussoni (2023) suggested that better regulations of companies may be effective in reducing the pressure on researchers to produce unethical research. Considering the serious consequences to human health of unethical research, this may be a potential solution worth exploring.</p>
