								<h2>End of Module Reflection</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
										<p>Coming into the Research Methods and Professional Practice module, I was not sure what to expect. However I am pleased to say that even though it was challenging, I found the course to be more engaging and interesting than I thought it would be. I work in the IT research and advisory field, developing new methodologies and tools to help CIOs and CISOs improve their cyber security processes. As a result of this background, I assumed that I was coming into this module with a good handle on the material, but that assumption quickly proved wrong. By working through the module, I discovered that there are significant differences in the objectives, outcomes, and methods between business-focused research and academic research. Adjusting to these differences has not always been easy, but I think it will prove beneficial.</p>

<p>Our first summative assignment was a literature review, where we had to select the topic from a set list. I selected the topic “the role of cyber security tools and practices in the reduction of cyberbullying”. My selection was primarily driven by the fact that I had worked on a similar topic in my Principles of Digital Forensics and Cyber Law module where I developed a presentation on the case of Amanda Todd, a Canadian teenager who committed suicide after years of online sexual extortion and cyberbullying. </p>

<p>I was nervous about this summative. Going into the assignment, my understanding of the purpose of a literature review was primarily to describe the current state of research on a topic and identify gaps to help define future research (Dawson, 2015). However, I also knew that criticality would be a significant component of the grading, and I doubted that simply identifying gaps would be satisfactorily critical. I adopted two approaches to address this concern. First, I developed a method of using a standard cyber security framework to organize the literature. This allowed me to more effectively identify gaps, while applying critical analysis between the different categories of cyber security tools and practices. Second, I attempted to perform a comparative analysis of the relative effectiveness of traditional versus cyber security approaches to the problem. I was satisfied with the results of the first approach, but less so with the second. I realized at the time that a proper comparison at this academic level should involve the use of a structured method such as qualitative comparative analysis (Roig-Tierno et al., 2017). However, I knew that I had neither the required time nor the extra room in my word count to do this. In future assignments, I would like to spend more time up front determining the critical methods that I might wish to employ, and budgeting the requisite time and word count.</p>

<p>In the end, I was mostly happy with my assignment and with most of the feedback. I was disappointed that much of the feedback related to my academic writing style, such as my use of bullet points. I had no reason to believe that bullets are to be avoided in academic writing;  previous tutors had encouraged their use as a means to maximize word count. However, that is a relatively easy issue to fix going forward.</p>

<p>The second summative assignment was a presentation on a research project proposal. The process of developing this presentation was quite a journey as it directly intersected with my thinking on the upcoming capstone project. Prior to beginning work on this assignment, I was leaning towards a capstone focused on creating efficiencies in cyber security risk assessments. It is a topic which I am very familiar with through work experience, and therefore appeared to be a safe choice. However, I elected to develop this assignment as a continuation of my literature review, and this soon caused me to start rethinking my capstone. The topic I selected was the development of a chatbot which could detect and intervene in anti-LGBTQ+ cyberbullying incidents on social networking sites. The more I engaged with this subject, the more I felt that my original capstone direction would be as boring as it was safe. Reorienting my capstone towards an anti-cyberbullying chatbot would be far more challenging, but also promised to be far more rewarding. </p>

<p>Working on the assignment was very interesting. I enjoyed the way that each section, from contributions to the field, through the research question, hypotheses, and aims and objectives all build on one another. I mentioned earlier that I do IT research for a living, but our approach is very business-focused, heavily using tools like problem statements, root cause analysis, and value propositions aimed towards an outcome of making a process more effective or efficient. The academic method required by this assignment was refreshing in that it provided a different perspective on how to approach research. The ethical considerations component was additionally very interesting, as I rarely engage with ethics beyond basic concerns like plagiarism during my work research. In particular, reading through the work of Meezan & Martin (2009) on ethical standards for research on LGBTQ+ communities was eye-opening due to the breadth of ethical issues involved.</p>

<p>Overall I was satisfied with the presentation, and felt that the feedback was fair. The main critique was that it required more criticality, which was not entirely unsurprising. At the moment, I am not sure how I could have added more criticality to a project proposal, but I freely admit that I probably did not seek out enough samples of exemplar proposals before starting the assignment. I will need to do further study in this area before tackling my capstone project.</p>

<p>In closing, I believe that this was an effective module that challenged me to fully appreciate and adopt a more academic approach to research, which I hope will additionally influence and improve the research which I do in my employment. I look forward to bringing the lessons learned here into my Master’s capstone project in the near future. </p>
