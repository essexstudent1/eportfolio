                    <p>Hi Jurbe. Thank you for the great post. I was very interested to hear that one of your group members had a
 latency delay of over 400ms at hop 2. Usually the first hop in a traceroute is from the local computer 
 to the local router, and hop 2 is the connection to the Internet Service Provider (Mitchell, 2014).
  This would mean that the high latency is likely a result of the Internet connection type used by this individual.
   According to Christiansen (2021), only satelite Internet connections tend to have latency over 400ms. 
</p>
<p>I would be interested to know if you determined the Internet connection type used by this individual,
 and whether you think that different connection types might affect security scans.</p>

										<p>Hi Elizabeth. I enjoyed your post. I found it particularly interesting that you were able to determine
 that the name servers for the site are actually hosted by "Cloudflaranet" rather than by a2hosting.com,
  which is what we would expect based on the nameserver domain names (Parziale et. al., 2006). In that regard,
   I believe that you took your research a step further than our group did.</p>

<p>However, I do want to suggest that if you had taken your research one additional step, you may have
 reconsidered your thoughts about the redundancy of the nameservers. Cloudflaranet is actually the
  company Cloudflare which, according to Williams (2022) is a very popular content delivery network (CDN)
  . A CDN works by caching files from websites and distributing the data across the globe. This results
   in faster access times, but also creates additional redundancy. Cloudflare claims that their DNS system
    provides "unparalleled redundancy" (Cloudflare, 2019).</p>

										<p>Hi Andrijana and thank you for the response. To help explain my rationale for arguing that the site is in Amsterdam,
 it is helpful to look at the results of my tracepath:</p>

<p>Internet providers often use IATA airport codes to identify the geographic location of routers on their network 
(Lamberti, 2020). In the tracepath, you can see that my local Internet Service Provider hands off my packets at 
hop 6 to Cogent Communications. Cogent clearly uses IATA codes, so you can read the path from hop 6 in Toronto
 (YYZ) to hop 7 in Montreal (YMQ) to hop 8 in Liverpool (LPL) to hop 9 in Amsterdam (AMS). At that point,
  Cogent hands the packets off to A2 Hosting for the last mile to our target server. If the packets continued
   back from Amsterdam to the USA, we would see additional hops after that.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that my longest delay occurs between 7 and 8, which is a trans-Atlantic 
hop from Montreal to Liverpool. Routing on the Internet is controlled by the Border Gateway Protocol 
(BGP). BGP uses many different factors to select a routing path, but generally speaking it tries to select 
the shortest, fastest, and/or most efficient route (IPXO, 2022). If the site really is in the USA, it would
 be illogical for my packets to go from Canada to the UK to the Netherlands, and then back across the ocean
  to the USA. </p>

									<p>Hi Jurbe. </p>

<p>Zorz (2019) describes how cognitive biases can undermine cybersecurity programs. Particularly relevant 
for this topic is anchoring and confirmation bias. Anchoring bias describes our tendency to accept the 
first piece of information that we come across as the absolute truth, and confirmation bias describes 
our tendency to only look for evidence that fits our theories. In this situation, I cannot help but feel 
that a number of people have performed a web-based IP address geolocation on the site and have 'anchored' 
Zorz (2019) describes how cognitive biases can undermine cybersecurity programs. Particularly relevant 
for this topic is anchoring and confirmation bias. Anchoring bias describes our tendency to accept the 
first piece of information that we come across as the absolute truth, and confirmation bias describes onto the result that the site should be in the USA. Confirmation bias has then prevented them from critically
 examining this anchor, and instead caused them to look only for data that supports this theory.</p>

<p>To address your specific point, Yacobi-Keller, et. al. (2009) describe how IP addresses associated with 
a single autonomous system (AS) need not be in a single country or even a single continent. </p>

<h4>Metasploit</h4>
<ul><li>Easy to install (just lots of next for windows, and for kali linux it’s just a command line)</li>
<li>Ease of use - you just call the function, set destination and the host</li>
<li>Flexibility - scan, build virus, password crackers, DOS, etc. Supports many OS. High risk because it makes the machine vulnerable. </li>
<li>Licensing - open source, some libraries or sources are inbuilt and they are sold on dark web. About 20-10% of libraries, sources are charged.</li>
<li>Reputation - the tool is well known for a long time. It is good for offensive hacking/pen testing. The companies do not use it publicly as it’s a dangerous tool.</li>
<li>Privacy - Hamad thinks that it is hard to prove that the software is not sharing any of your machine data during the scans. </li></ul>

<h4>Nessus</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of install - easy to install.</li>
<li>Ease of use - you set up the host name/IP and scan.</li>
<li>Flexibility - extra steps to go through if you have cloud deployments. It’s more difficult to customise</li>
<li>Licensing - they charge, but they offer a trial month (with limited reports).</li>
<li>Reputation - known tool. </li>
<li>Privacy - privacy documents in place to ensure your data is secure.</li></ul>

<h4>Nmap</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of install - easy.</li>
<li>Ease of use - CLI based, it’s harder to use because you need to know the commands.</li>
<li>Flexibility - not customisable.</li>
<li>Licensing - free.</li>
<li>Reputation - very well know.</li>
<li>Privacy - local installation is very safe, everything is stored on your machine. Online privacy is unknown, i.e. we don’t know if they keep the reports or email it to someone -  we cannot prove it is 100% confidential. Most people tend to use online version, so your IP is not exposed.</li></ul>

<h4>Burp</h4>
<ul><li>Easy installation</li>
<li>Ease of use - local certificate must be generated, imported into the browser you wish to use so that everything is cached on your machine. More for experienced users.</li>
<li>Licensing - free and paid version (pro and enterprise). Pro is not very expensive, but the enterprise is very pricey.</li>
<li>Privacy - the tool is installed on your machine, so as long as you keep your machine safe, the data is safe.</li></ul>

<h4>OWASP</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of install - easy</li>
<li>Ease of use - easy to use.</li>
<li>Flexibility - supports many OS. It is open source; developers can change the source code to suit their needs. Both manual and auto scanning allowed.</li>
<li>Privacy - plugins may be unsecure, some code could be manipulated.</li>
<li>https://www.peerspot.com/products/owasp-zap-reviews</li></ul>

<h4>SQLmap</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of use - Linux and need to know commands.</li>
<li>Flexibility - it supports all types of databases, except non-SQL based.</li>
<li>Licensing - open source</li>
<li>Reputation - well reviewed in the IT community</li>
<li>Privacy - open source, installed locally</li></ul>

<h4>Kali linux</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of install - Abidemi had issues installing it on her machine</li>
<li>Ease of use - requires Linux command line use</li>
<li>Flexibility - customizable, just not easy to do.</li>
<li>Licensing - free, although some custom paid apps, but the main suite is free of charge.</li>
<li>Privacy - it can come packed with viruses, worms, etc</li></ul>

<h4>Jawfish</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of use - python knowledge needed for some things, they do offer free training</li>
<li>Flexibility - customisable with pyton</li>
<li>Licensing - free</li>
<li>Reputation - open source, fairly new, not as popular</li>
<li>Privacy - open source, not much more known.</li></ul>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>This week was the first test of whether the personality traits that I described in unit 1 would be problematic.
As mentioned then, I have a tendency towards "know-it-all-ism", an irrational need to appear smarter than others.
It is a particularly unflattering behaviour pattern.</p>

<p>The topic this week was basic networking, which was a nice refresher for me. I did a lot of network engineering
in the early-to-mid 2000's, and earned the Cisco Certified Network Professional designation, before 
deciding to focus my career on information security. </p>

<p>Most of the questions in this assignment were boringly easy. However the last one - "where is the server
located?" - was a bit more interesting. I love solving a good technical mystery and went to work on it.
I eventually placed the server in Amsterdam, even figuring out which trans-Atlantic submarine cable my packets
most likely traversed (the "Hibernia Express", a new cable that just went into production in 2015). Of course,
I quickly learned that my team members had all just performed a simple IP address geolocation and settled on the 
location as the USA. I had to convince them that my answer was correct -- without being obnoxious about it.
This ended up being a lot harder than I expected. It was my word versus the word of an authoritative-looking
website. Fortunately I was able to win them over, hopefully without coming off as a cad.
</p>
	<p>Finally, we wrapped up the discussion on the medical mannequin vulnerabilities this week. I found this exercise particularly
		enjoyable as it gave me an opportunity to do some research into real-life wireless hacking as well as some theoretical
		research into how consumer drones could be employed in wireless attacks.</p>
										
<h4>Technical Challenges Update</h4>

<p>In my last reflection, I mentioned my challenge with creating references. It occurred to me that maybe there
are browser plug-ins that could do this, so I looked into it a bit and decided to try one out. I settled on
"cite this for me". Unfortunately, the extension is far from perfect and seems unable to find the author's
name. It is helpful, but without the author's name, I still have to perform extra manual steps to create
a reference. I may try a different plugin next week.</p>
