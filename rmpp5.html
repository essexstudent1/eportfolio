									<h2>Reflective Activity 2</h2>
									<p>In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.</p>

<p>Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.</p>

<p>Record your findings in your e-Portfolio. You can also submit your findings to your tutor for formative feedback.</p>

                    <p>For years, Cambridge Analytica exploited weaknesses in the Facebook platform to collect personal data on millions of Facebook users through the use of surveys (Graham-Harrison & Cadwalladr, 2018). The data was used primarily to influence the outcomes of elections in the USA and UK.</p>

<p>Another example of unethical practices in surveys is the use of online surveys and quizzes which seek to discover answers to common security questions used by organizations to identify customers who have forgotten their passwords (Krebsonsecurity.com, 2018). A final example of inappropriate surveys is referred to as ‘Sugging’, or selling under the guise of research (Hopper, 2020).</p>

<p>The overall impact of these types of surveys is to increase the level of distrust in individuals towards any type of survey. </p>
