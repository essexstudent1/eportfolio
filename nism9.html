                    <p>Hi Elizabeth. This was an interesting case study. It is hard to imagine modern organizations still
 hand writing envelopes, yet here we are.</p>

<p>Implementing security controls over manual processes is very difficult. I used to work for a large
 insurance company back when they would still take printouts of policy statements and hand stuff the
  envelopes. We had a notorious problem with "double stuffing"; putting two printouts from different
   customers into the same envelope. </p>

<p>I really appreciate your recommendation to move to a secure email system instead of mailing statements. 
However, moving to email does introduce a new potential risk that needs to be resolved, which is the
 problem of data retention and data erasion. Because Article 17 of the GDPR allows data subjects to 
 request the erasure of their personal data, organizations must ensure that they are able to locate 
 and delete all copies of emails which contain personal data (gdpr.eu, 2018). </p>

										<p>Hi Tebogo. This was an interesting case because the regulator in question ruled that the organization in 
question had acted properly, and therefore no security incident occurred (Data Protection Commission, 2017). 
At issue was Section 4 of the Data Protection Acts. Section 4 generally grants data subjects the right of
 access to their personal data, however 4(4) clarifies that data controllers should not release the personal 
 data of third parties as part of that right to access without the third party's consent for the disclosure
  (Data Protection Comissioner, 2018). </p>

<p>In this case, there was no security incident. In order to help reduce the risk of security incidents related 
to access rights requests, organizations could consider implementing a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR)
 management tool. A DSAR management tool can help ensure that access requests are met in a timely manner
  while ensuring compliance with all sections of the GDPR (Ramirez, 2020).</p>

						<h3>Reponse to Peer Response 1</h3>
									<p>In addition to the peer responses, I also responded to a peer responses on my post at https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=306105</p>

										<p>Hi Ags. Thank you for the response. You are absolutely correct that the incidents identified in
 the case study could be considered insider threats, and that insider threat detection tools and
  processes should be implemented to address this risk. The main challenge with this solution is that
   most insider threat management programs involve significant tracking and monitoring of employee behavior.
    This comes with its own set of privacy issues which additionally need to be managed 
    (Liber, A., & Bereczki, T., 2019). </p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>This week was another interesting unit, revisiting the case studies from last unit. The Lecture Cast was
all about logging and forensics. This got me to thinking about how logging and forensics would play a part
in the case studies. However this came to me too late to be of use in my peer responses. I will need to make
sure that next week when I do the summary post that I speak more about this topic.</p>

<p>For our team assignment we are starting to approach crunch time again. Unfortunately I have been sick for
a few days and unable to get much done (not covid fortunately, but some sort of cold or flu). I am going to
need to really hunker down this weekend to make up for lost time.</p>
