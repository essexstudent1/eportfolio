                    <p>For this week's discussion, we decided to post as a group rather than individuals. I believe that we were the only
			group to decide to do so. Our post is provided in the previous unit.</p>

<p>There were no specific team assignments for this unit. See the Reflections section for an update on our design document assignment.</p>


                  
                  

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>This was a mercifully light week. For the collaborative discussion, we were given the option to post either
as a team or as individuals, so we opted to post as a team. Even better, we were all ready to go since we had
already put the material together as part of last week's team assignment. </p>

<p>For this week's seminar on OSI and TCP/IP, we were asked to read a history of networking protocols and answer
the question "Would the Internet we have today be much better if it was based on the ISO/ OSI 7-layer model
rather than TCP/IP?â€œ. As with the previous seminar, this was a refresher for me as I had to study this topic
inside out and backwards twenty years ago while studying for Cisco certification exams. </p>

<p>With relatively light weekly assignments, our group was able to start working on our unit 6 assignment in
earnest. The Google Doc where we are keeping our preliminary findings and discussions is up to 15 pages now,
with a bunch of lengthy comments besides. The entire group is contributing well, and it is great to see
a wide range of perspectives.</p>

<h4>Technical Challenges Update</h4>

<p>The other thing that I spent time on this week was trying to solve my e-portfolio challenges, specifically
the need to dedicate significant amounts of time just manually hand coding HTML/CSS tags. For instance, my workflow for
the collaborative discussion posts is currently something like this:</p>

<ol><li>Write the post in Google Docs</li>
<li>Copy the post into the advanced editor on the Essex Online platform and format it</li>
<li>Copy the post from the EO platform and paste it into an html document in GitHub</li>
<li>Manually hand code all of the header, paragraph, list, and other required tags</li></ol>

<p>This takes far more time than it should, and makes updating the e-portfolio a dreaded chore. I have tried using
the GitHub HTML editor, but it really does not help at all when pasting text in. I've tried putting the
text into OpenOffice and saving it as an HTML file, but that just adds a ton of extra CSS tags that I 
then manually have to fix. </p>

<p>What I really need is either a WYSIWYG editor that just outputs plain HTML tags rather than CSS, or an 
editor where I can paste in some text, highlight it, and tell it to add opening and closing tags around it.
It really shouldn't be that hard to find, and yet it is. </p>
