								  <h2>Objectives</h2>
								  <ul>
								    <li>Introduce the different methods of obtaining responses.</li>
								    <li>Discuss how to improve the responses you obtain.</li>
								    <li>Consider how you would analyse the responses from each type of question.</li>
								   </ul>
									<h2>e-Portfolio update: Data Collection</h2>
									<p>Think about which data collection tool will be suitable for your area of investigation (in this module and/or in your Project module). How will you collect it and what analysis would you hope to perform? How will this answer your research question? This should also be included in the presentation of your Project Proposal in Unit 10.</p>

                    							<p>Assuming that I decide upon a capstone project topic of “Use of Machine Learning to aid security risk assessments”, I feel like there are two main research questions:</p>
										
										<ol>
											<li>What is the purpose of a security risk assessment?</li>
								    <li>Can an ML system effectively conduct a security risk assessment, or at least aid in the production of a risk assessment?</li>
										</ol>
										
									<p>The first question would seem to call for a qualitative research approach. This would likely require a literature review followed by a questionnaire. The analysis of the data would include looking for consensus amongst respondents on the primary required outcomes of a risk assessment.</p>
										
									<p>The second question would likely call for a more quantitative approach and will probably be more difficult. I would need to determine if an ML system could perform a risk assessment to the same degree of effectiveness as a security professional, in less time. This will probably require the use of experiments to compare the results of a risk assessment on a single target system done by a professional and an ML system, with a set of metrics to determine success levels.</p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
								<p>This week I recieved the following feedback from the tutor on my literature review outline:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote><p>Thank you for submitting your Literature review proposal.</p>

<p>Your outline for study is clear you appear to already have a good list of research references at this stage
which is promising. This is a good approach as the more diverse your research, the more opportunity you
have for deep research, but also varied sources for citation for your actual summative Literature Review as
well.</p>

<p>2,000 words for the Literature Review summative is not a lot, and so do keep a focus absolutely on the core
topic of research that you want to engage with. It is easy for tangents to creep into a study of this nature,
which eats up word count, and then by default means there is not enough word count to fully investigate
your subject on the required ‘deeper’level. I’m mentioning this as if discussion is too broad then this
approach only allows for shallow research of topics.</p>

<p>As we have discussed in seminars, this module focuses only on secondary research, and therefore I’m
mentioning in feedback to keep your research focus on existing literature. Please do not interview/survey
people for this project.</p></blockquote>
                    
                    <p>I am pretty happy with this feedback and need to get to work on the assignment. I do particurly note the comment about
keeping the scope tight at risk of doing too shallow a dive into the topic.</p>

<p>This week we were also encouraged to reach out to potential supervisor for our Master's capstone project. This caused me
some consternation as I still don't really understand what the project needs to accomplish, and therefore am not sure what
I am going to do. However I did have a meeting with my tutor from my Human Factors course and had a pretty good conversation
with him. I proposed the idea of creating an ML-based risk assessment system. He did like that idea and felt that I would
have enough time to adequately learn the subject. His main concern was finding appropriate data to teach the ML system, which actually
aligns well with the reflective activity this week about data collection. He gave me a few suggestions. I will start to look into those.</p>
