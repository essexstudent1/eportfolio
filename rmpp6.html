								  <h2>Objectives</h2>
								  <ul>
								    <li>Introduce the different methods of obtaining responses.</li>
								    <li>Discuss how to improve the responses you obtain.</li>
								    <li>Consider how you would analyse the responses from each type of question.</li>
								   </ul>
									<h2>Wiki Activity: Questionnaires</h2>
									<p>Find a questionnaire and critique the design, both the format and the questions used.</p>

<p>Consider areas such as ‘why is this question included?’, ‘is the form of the question appropriate?’ etc. How can you improve the questionnaire?</p>

<p>Put your analysis in the module wiki and comment on others’ analyses.</p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
								<p>This week I recieved the following feedback from the tutor on my literature review outline:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote><p>Thank you for submitting your Literature review proposal.</p>

<p>Your outline for study is clear you appear to already have a good list of research references at this stage
which is promising. This is a good approach as the more diverse your research, the more opportunity you
have for deep research, but also varied sources for citation for your actual summative Literature Review as
well.</p>

<p>2,000 words for the Literature Review summative is not a lot, and so do keep a focus absolutely on the core
topic of research that you want to engage with. It is easy for tangents to creep into a study of this nature,
which eats up word count, and then by default means there is not enough word count to fully investigate
your subject on the required ‘deeper’level. I’m mentioning this as if discussion is too broad then this
approach only allows for shallow research of topics.</p>

<p>As we have discussed in seminars, this module focuses only on secondary research, and therefore I’m
mentioning in feedback to keep your research focus on existing literature. Please do not interview/survey
people for this project.</p></blockquote>
                    
                    <p>I am pretty happy with this feedback and need to get to work on the assignment. I do particurly note the comment about
keeping the scope tight at risk of doing too shallow a dive into the topic.</p>

<p>This week we were also encouraged to reach out to potential supervisor for our Master's capstone project. This caused me
some consternation as I still don't really understand what the project needs to accomplish, and therefore am not sure what
I am going to do. However I did have a meeting with my tutor from my Human Factors course and had a pretty good conversation
with him. I proposed the idea of creating an ML-based risk assessment system. He did like that idea and felt that I would
have enough time to adequately learn the subject. His main concern was finding appropriate data to teach the ML system,
but gave me a few suggestions. I will start to look into those.</p>
