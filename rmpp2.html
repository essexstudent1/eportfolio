										<h3>Peer Response</h3>	
										
                    <p>Hi Sherelle. Thank you for the thoughtful post.</p>

<p>One thought that kept occurring to me while reading the case study is whether malware could be considered the most ethical solution to the problem of a rogue web hosting provider. The case study made it clear that ACM believed the malware authors to be acting ethically despite the consequences to innocent parties (ACM, 2018). However, did those authors have other options at their disposal to disrupt Rogue which would have been more ethical than releasing malware? After all, the unwanted consequences of their malware may not have ended with just hurting Rogue’s customers. Even malware designed for ethical purposes can be analyzed and repurposed by threat actors for malicious purposes. For example, it is widely assumed that the U.S. National Security Agency developed an exploit nicknamed EternalBlue for use in supposedly ethical malware. Unfortunately the EternalBlue code was leaked and subsequently used to develop two of the most damaging worms in history, WannaCry and NotPetya (Greenberg, 2018).</p>

<p>Presumably, the malware authors in this case study had other options. For instance, a distributed denial of service attack against Rogue may have been an effective way to disrupt their malicious operations without causing any permanent damage to their innocent customers (Schneier, 2016). Do you believe that “the good guys” have a moral imperative to always select the most ethical solution to the problem of a rogue web hosting provider?</p>

                    <p>Hi Andrea. This case study was very interesting and shines light on many of the ethical questions which arise from the use of autonomous weapon systems (De Witte, 2019).</p>

<p>The case study was clear that ACM felt that the engineers who resigned were acting ethically (ACM Ethics, 2018). However, the case study was silent on another, very important, question; what about the engineers who didn’t resign? Were they justified in holding onto their jobs? If those engineers were members of the British Computer Society, do you believe that BCS should expel them for violating the BCS Code of Conduct?</p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>I continued to have a poor start to this module as I was still quite sick for most of this past week. However I was able to get in my peer responses to the collaborative discussion, and additionally started thinking about my literature review assignment.</p>

<p>I am leaning towards the topic “Implementing Cyber Security tools and/or techniques in the reduction of cyberbullying”. This is mostly because I did some amount of work in this space as part of my presentation on the Amanda Todd case in a previous module. I am a bit worried, though, because the tutor did not give me great grades in that module. The feedback was that I did not engage in enough “criticality”, so this is something that I will need to pay more attention to in this module.</p>

<p>I am also starting to think about the research proposal and about my MSc capstone project, but I still have a lot of questions about what is expected in the capstone. I would like to get some answers to those questions before I put too much work into the proposal.</p>
