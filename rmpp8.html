                    <p>Hi Andrea. Thank you for the detailed post.</p>

<p>I am wondering if you could expand on the point that Abi is "responsible for the use of his program results by others". I agree with your point that Abi needs to ensure that his results are as accurate and reliable as possible (Rucker & Rucker, 2016), but I am unclear on how his responsibility extends to how others put the results into use.That is, if Abi provides a full and balanced set of results to the manufacturer, but the manufacturer then does something unethical with those results, is Abi responsible for their unethical use of his data?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

                    <p>Hi Mohammad. I enjoyed reading your post.</p>

<p>You mention that Abi should just provide the full results of his research to the manufacturer, and that afterwards he cannot be held responsible for what the manufacturer does with that data. However, data needs to be interpreted and translated for use by stakeholders. Rucker & Rucker (2016) makes a strong argument that researchers who are not involved in the interpretation of their research may be complicit in the mis-use of that research. </p>

<p>A particularly infamous example of this comes from the case of the Sugar Research Foundation, which often took data from researchers and interpreted it in ways which minimized the harms associated with sugar consumption (Kearns, 2016). </p>

<p>I would be curious to hear your thoughts on how far researchers need to go in order to combat misuse of their findings.</p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
										<p>I received my feedback on my literature review. My grade was okay, but based on the feedback provided, I felt that it should have been better. In particular I was disappointed that the tutor deducted points from Criticality based on issues she had with my academic writing skills. Perceived issues with the writing should really have gone into the Structure & Presentation criteria (10%) rather than Criticality (30%). I was also disappointed that the grade was reduced for things such as the use of bullet points in the paper. In all of my previous modules, the tutors have encouraged bullet points as a good way of organizing information and reducing word count, so it feels somewhat unfair to be told now that they are not acceptable.</p>
										
										<p>In other news, I am considering changing direction on my capstone project (and hence also on my research project proposal assignment). The more I think of it, the more I think that an ML-based approach to risk assessments is frankly rather uninspiring. I would like to do something that would advance a purpose, and I keep coming back to the cyberbullying issue. I am going to meet with my potential supervisor again to discuss the possibility of developing a cyberbullying intervention chatbot for the capstone. It will be a serious stretch for me, but I know that when I am inspired by a topic, I can do some impressive work.</p>
