									<p>Pick a case study from the examples provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).</p>

									<p>Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved. You should provide comparisons to the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct.</p>

										<h3>Initial Post</h3>	
										<p>The case study on malware disruption describes a situation where a web hosting provider, Rogue Services, has allowed its infrastructure to be used by cyber criminals (ACM Ethics, 2018a). Despite numerous complaints about the malicious nature of their customers, Rogue refused to take any action, prompting a group of security vendors and government organizations to use targeted malware to infect and disrupt Rogue’s services. The malware was designed to not spread beyond Rogue’s systems, but it did impact all of Rogue’s legitimate customers as well as the malicious ones. The case study concluded that Rogue had violated several principles of the ACM Code of Ethics, and that the malware authors had acted in accordance with the Code. However ACM also concluded that the authors could have done more to comply with general principle 1.2 (“Avoid harm”) by engineering the malware to not spread to Rogue’s legitimate customers.</p>
<p>This case study highlights the challenges of applying legal remedies to cyber security issues where multiple jurisdictions are involved. Cyber attacks easily cross international borders, and it is possible for an attack to originate in one jurisdiction but target a victim in another jurisdiction (Bott, 2014). When the originating jurisdiction does not have laws prohibiting this activity, the victims have limited legal recourse. In this case study, the malware authors most likely believed that, in the absence of a legal remedy, the most expedient solution to the harms being caused by Rogue’s malicious customers was to disrupt Rogue’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>In comparing the case study against the BCS Code of Conduct, the main principles to consider are 1(b) (“have due regard for the legitimate rights of Third Parties”) and 2(f) (“avoid injuring others… by false or malicious or negligent action or inaction”) (BCS, 2015). Applying these principles to the case study would seem to arrive at the same conclusion, which is that the malware authors acted ethically in disrupting Rogue’s infrastructure, but could have done more to remove the negative consequences on Rogue’s innocent customers.</p>
