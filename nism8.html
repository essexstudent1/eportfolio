									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 3 - Part 1</h2>
									<p>Read the website at Data Protection Commission (2020) CaseStudies|DataProtection Commission Available from: https://dataprotection.ie/en/pre-gdpr/case-studies</p>

<p>There are several case studies published during years 2014 – 2018 concerning GDPR related issues and breaches. Considering the case study you have chosen answer the following questions:</p>

<ol><li>What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</li>
<li>How was it resolved?</li>
<li>If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</li></ol>

<p>Post your responses to the discussion. Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long. The initial post should be labelled ‘Initial Post’.</p>

                    <h3>Initial Post</h3>
																				
                    <p>For this assignment, I reviewed the case study “Prosecution of Eamon O’Mordha & Company Limited and one of
 Its Directors” (Data Protection Commission, 2017). Eamon O’Mordha & Company was a special investigations 
 firm which performed work for insurance companies providing surveillance of individuals who had filed personal
  injury claims (Tuite, 2017). The Data Protection Commission became suspicious of how the company had come 
  into possession of some of the personal data in the reports which they had passed on to their clients.
   During the course of their investigation, the Commission discovered that employees and directors of the
    company had used family and friends to obtain data from the Department of Social Protection and An
     Garda Síochána. </p>

<p>The offenses breached section 22 of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. Section 22 makes it illegal 
to obtain personal data without the approval of the data controller or data processor, and then disclose
 the information to another person (Data Protection Commissioner, 2008). The case was resolved when the 
 company and the director in question both pled guilty to a number of the charges and were fined €10,000 each.</p>

<p>An information security manager at Eamon O’Mordha & Company Limited would have had limited means to stop
 this offense. It would not be considered an information security incident for a director of the company
  to telephone one of her nephews and request information. The information security incidents related to 
  this case study were at the Department of Social Protection and An Garda Síochána. However an information
   security manager at one of these organizations could have mitigated the incident with the following controls:</p>
   
<ul><li>Data classification policy. This would allow the organization to classify data according to its confidentiality, integrity, or availability requirements, and then deploy safeguards appropriate to the classification (Brook, 2018).</li>
<li>Data loss prevention (DLP). DLP technologies and processes can support a data classification policy by monitoring and blocking unauthorized transfers of data (De Groot, 2020). </li>
<li>Need to know principle. Computer systems should be configured with access controls to ensure that users are only granted access to the information that they require to carry out their authorized duties (Isms.online, ND).</li></ul>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>This was actually a very enjoyable week. I loved the case study assignment as part of the collaborative
discussion. Researching a real world case study and applying learned knowledge to it is very satisfying.
I do rather wish that the case studies were a bit more technical. My case study, for instance, involved
a private investigator simply calling up her nephews and friends in the government and police and asking
for favours. Even still, it was a good way to think about how security controls can interact with 
real world privacy breaches. I'd be happy to see more case study assignments in future modules. </p>
