									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 3 - Part 3</h2>
									<p>In unit 10, provide a summary of the discussion based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers. This is your `Summary` post. Agree or otherwise, with reasons, with the contributions and reviews made by other students on the topic under discussion, enhancing your original post. </p>

                  <h3>Summary Post</h3>
									                 																
									<div class="box">
																				
                    <p>In this collaborative discussion, we reviewed a number of case studies involving GDPR investigations 
undertaken by the Data Protection Commission (2020). Many of these case studies involved data subject
 access requests (DSARs). Ashmore (2022) and Klacar (2022) for instance both describe cases involving
  DSARs for surveillance video. The case study that I reviewed related to a private investigator who used
   contacts at the government and the police to obtain personal data on subjects without consent 
   (Peuhkurinen, 2022). My recommendations focused on data protection controls.</p>

<p>One post in particular I found very interesting. Cook (2022) described how a manual process for addressing 
envelopes at a hospital resulted in personal data being mailed to the wrong recipient. Cook recommended that
 the risks involved in manual processes could be mitigated by automating the process through a secure email
  function, and that this solution would additionally allow for audit trails to record who accessed the data.</p>

<p>This was a theme that Angelides (2022) elaborated on in response to my post, suggesting that proper logging 
can alert when authorised employees access or share data for an unauthorised purpose. Based upon the insights
 from Cook and Angelides, I now conclude that my initial recommendations were incomplete and should have 
 included the need for audit logging and log analysis. Audit log analysis can be used for both incident 
 detection and for forensic investigations (Campbell, 2016).</p>

									<h2>Data Breach Case Study</h2>

<p>Read Swinhoe, D., 2020. The 15 Biggest Data Breaches Of The 21St Century. [online] CSO Online.</p>

<p>Select one of the cases by completing Data Breach choice. Once you have made your selection, you will be able to see the links to the case. Then complete a breach checklist as discussed in the lecturecast (reproduced below):</p>

<ol><li>What types of data were affected?</li>
<li>What happened?</li>
<li>Who was responsible?</li>
<li>Were any escalation(s) stopped - how?</li>
<li>Was the Business Continuity Plan instigated?</li>
<li>Was the ICO notified?</li>
<li>Were affected individuals notified?</li>
<li>What were the social, legal and ethical implications of the decisions made?</li></ol>

<p>If you had been the ISM for the organisation you selected what mitigations would you have put in place to stop any reoccurrences?</p>

   <p>For this case study, I chose MySpace.</p>


<h4>What types of data were affected?</h4>

<p>Personal data in the form of user accounts, including user names, email addresses, and passwords.</p>

<h4>What happened?</h4>

<p>Hackers compromised 360 million user accounts and put them up on a hacker forum called LeakedSource.com. </p>


<h4>Who was responsible?</h4>

<p>MySpace attributed to the attack to a Russian hacker known as Peace.</p>


<h4>Were any escalation(s) stopped - how?</h4>

<p>I am sorry, I do not understand the question. However, the attack was limited to only user accounts on an
older version of the MySpace platform, so only accounts which had been created before June 2013. Presumably
the newer MySpace platform had improved security which kept the attackers from compromising new accounts.</p>


<h4>Was the Business Continuity Plan instigated?</h4>

<p>There is no evidence that MySpace had to execute a BCP. The attack was on an older version of the MySpace
platform and appears to have not affected their production system.</p>


<h4>Was the ICO notified?</h4>

<p>The hack occurred in 2016, two years before GDPR came into effect. There is no reporting to indicate that
the ICO was informed. MySpace did report the incident to law enforcement.</p>


<h4>Were affected individuals notified?</h4>

<p>MySpace notified their users via a blog post on their system. Affected user accounts also had their passwords
reset so that they had to change them upon next user.</p>


<h4>What were the social, legal and ethical implications of the decisions made?</h4>

<p>Once the largest social media website on the planet, MySpace had declined in use significantly in the late
2000's and early 2010's. By the time this breach occurred in 2016, most news outlets treated the story as
almost a joke. There is no indication that MySpace was every sued or fined as a result of the breach.</p>


<h4>If you had been the ISM for the organisation you selected what mitigations would you have put in place to 
stop any reoccurrences?</h4>

<p>MySpace appears to have already put many of the required mitigations into place by 2016 for their new
platform, including proper encryption and salting of passwords. One control that should have been already
implemented would be the proper decommissioning of legacy systems which are no longer in use. Older systems
with known security weaknesses should be archived and taken offline.</p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>This was not my finest week, at least not in the collaborative discussion. As I mentioned last week, 
I was losing patience a bit and this week I clearly lost it. </p>

<p>I stand by the premise of my summary post, which is that cyber attackers often employ stealth and
 redirection in order to obfuscate their origins and hide their tracks, and therefore cybersecurity
   professionals need to approach problems with critical thinking, and need to understand when cognitive 
	biases are getting in their way. However I was feeling rushed and stressed-out, and did not think
   through how I should communicate these thoughts. What came out was condescending and insulting,
    and I was mortified when I re-read it the next day.</p>

<p>I hate making excuses for myself, but I do think it is fair to point out that I am feeling under a 
lot of pressure right now. Also, at the risk of being TMI, I am into month four of transgender hormone 
replacement therapy, and my emotions are a complete rollercoaster ride. Transitioning while working
 full-time and taking a postgraduate degree was not the best idea. Although, to be fair, when I started
  working on applying for this program last June, I had no intention of transitioning. That only happened
   after intense therapy in the early fall, after I had already gotten funding and been accepted into the
    program. Going forward, I think I just need to check myself more, especially when posting in collaborative
     discussions.</p>

<p>The better news this week is that we completed our team design document assignment. It took a marathon
Zoom collaboration session on Sunday, but I feel like we did a pretty good job overall. The hardest part 
of this was completing the peer review. I was a bit disappointed that some of the team members were not
 contributing as much as the rest. For instance, we had all agreed that we would each contribute 3 vulnerabilities
  to the report and would then pare them down based on the word count. That should have given us 15 vulnerabilities 
  to work with, but we only had 10 and it was clear that at least one person had not contributed any data.
   I ended up looking through the edit history in Google Docs to see who had contributed what to the document
    and based my peer reviews largely on that.</p>

<p>Anyway, we’re now passed the half-way point in this course, so must keep working away!</p>
