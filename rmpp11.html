								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>For this week’s e-Portfolio, we were asked to write a reflective piece on a specific module within our program which we felt would be particularly impactful. I have decided to select the module 
Principles of Digital Forensics and Cyber Law (PDFCYL) for this reflection. It was my most challenging module, and therefore the one with the most lessons. This reflection will be structured using the Gibbs Reflective Cycle (Taylor, 2020).</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This module had three summative assignments. The first was a presentation on a specific instance of a cybercrime. The second was a blog post on cyber identity theft in a specific country. The third was an expert review on the same topic. The presentation went well, and I received a distinction grade. However, things went sour from there. I very nearly failed the blog post assignment, receiving the poorest grade I have seen since high school. </p>

<h4>Feelings</h4>

<p>I was very clearly shook to the core by the grade on the second assignment. I felt angry towards the tutor, but more so disappointment in myself. In reflecting back on this moment now, I am starting to realize how much of my sense of self-worth has always been dependent on good academic performance. This is likely the result of having been severely bullied as a queer child growing up. While research shows that bullying tends to depress grades, some victims compensate for the social isolation caused by being bullied by engaging in more study (Yu & Zhao, 2021).</p>

<h4>Evaluation</h4>

<p>The clear issue for my grade on this assignment was criticality, which received a marginal fail. It is apparent that I do not fully grasp the concept of criticality as it applies to academic output.</p>

<h4>Analysis</h4>

<p>Going into this module, I had never been taught what is meant by criticality. I believed that it simply referred to the process of thinking critically about a topic, and evidencing this by providing critiques of specific ideas. I was mistaken, but apparently this is a common mistake as many students fail to grasp the requirements behind this term (Liu et al., 2015). Correcting this mistake in the future will be vital for future academic success.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this may be easier said than done. Simpson & Dervin (2020) point out that despite a widespread assumption that students understand the terminology, criticality and critical thinking are actually highly dependent on culture and linguistics. Therefore, understanding what is meant by criticality in an educational program requires understanding the tradition of critical thinking in the language and the place of the institution.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The primary conclusion I can draw from this reflection is that criticality is both exceptionally important for academic success, but also non-obvious to students, especially those from outside the cultural or linguistic tradition of the school. This suggests that I need to do more work on understanding what is expected from criticality at the University of Essex.</p>

<h4>Action Plan</h4>

<p>In the future, and especially for my capstone project, I need to review additional material and samples of exemplary research to better understand how to satisfy the expectations related to criticality and critical thinking. </p>
