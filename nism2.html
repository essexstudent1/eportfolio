                    <p>Hi Sherelle. I appreciate your post and especially some of the more novel mitigations you have suggested.</p>

<p>I think that direct denial of service attacks against medical devices themselves is probably an unlikely
 real world threat. However, attacks that result in denial of service against the controlling systems are 
 already happening. For instance, ransomware attacks against a German hospital in 2020 are believed to have
  accounted for deaths as patients were turned away due to failures of the IT infrastructure (Slabodkin, 2021). </p>

<p>I like your suggestion of using threat detection services to provide early warning of denial of service attacks.
 One potentially interesting mitigation might be the use of honeypots. Honeypots are systems that mimic
  potentially valuable targets, so when an attack is launched against one, it can immediately alert the
   cyber security team. Brook (2016) describes how researchers were able to use honeypots that mimic 
   medical devices to discover numerous attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in those devices. These results 
   could make the case for the use of honeypots in medical environments.</p>

										<p>Hi Ags. I think you are correct regarding your conclusions about mitigating the brute force attacks.
 However, I am not entirely sure if your proposed mitigation against the denial of service would be
  effective in this case.</p>

<p>You have suggested that a network firewall could be an effective control for this type of attack. 
I agree with you that network firewalls can mitigate certain types of denial of service attacks.
 However in order to perform their packet filtering functions, network firewalls need to be located 
 on a network between a potential attacker and the target (Campbell, 2016). In the case of the iStan 
 mannequin, the denial of service attack was conducted using the MDK3 security testing tool
  (Glisson, et. al., 2015). The purpose of MDK3 is to test 802.11 wireless networks (Sankar, 2018).
   Since the attack test took place wirelessly between the attacking system and the access point built
    into the medical mannequin, I do not see how a network firewall could be employed to mitigate the attack.
     I may be mistaken on this point, but I would love to hear if you have any further thoughts on using 
     firewalls to mitigate wireless attacks.</p>

									<h2>Team Assignment</h2>

<p>The team assignment this week was to prepare for seminar 2 on STRIDE and DREAD by assigning DREAD ratings to the vulnerabilities identified
                  in the paper.</p>
                  
                  
                  
									<div class="box">
										<h3>DREAD Ratings</h3>	
                    
                    <table><tr><th>DREAD category</th>
<th>Brute force attack</th>
<th>DOS attack</th></tr>

<tr><td>Damage potential</td>
<td>3 (attacker could gain access to the access point login details, thus getting access to the whole network)</td>
<td>1 (the mannequin would be taken offline impacting only the small group of people)</td></tr>

<tr><td>Reproducibility</td>
<td>3 (the attack can be reproduced at any time)</td>
<td>3 (the attack can be reproduced at any time)</td></tr>

<tr><td>Exploitability</td>
<td>3 (the attack can be carried out by anyone with basic computer understanding)</td>
<td>3 (the attack can be carried out by anyone with basic computer understanding)</td></tr>

<tr><td>Affected users</td>
<td>3 (after gaining access point security details, the follow up attack could impact the whole network)</td>
<td>1 (DOS would impact users of the particular mannequin only)</td></tr>

<tr><td>Discoverability</td>
<td>3 (WPS vulnerability has been known for a long time, the step by step guides are available)</td>
<td>3 (The TPS network protocol vulnerabilities are well known)</td></tr></table>

										
											<p>The resulting risk total for a brute force attack is 15 (high risk) and 11 (Medium risk). 
Thus, the brute force attack on a medical mannequin would have a larger impact on the medical 
training facility than the DOS attack. Please note, that the ‘Affected users’ DREAD category was
 considered to also include other users within the medical training facility network and not only
  those directly working with the training mannequin.</p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
										<p>We're into our second week, and after submitting our group contract we again had no time to waste as
we needed to prepare for seminar 2 on STRIDE and DREAD. Fortunately I am very familiar with both of
these concepts, having worked with STRIDE in risk assessments for years. STRIDE continues to be used
out in the wild, although most practitioners tack on an additional category for "lateral movement" now
when using it for network-based risk assessments as opposed to its original use for application risk
assessments.</p>

<p>As a threat modeling methodology, STRIDE has significant problems. For one thing, the threat categories are not very
intuitive -- very few people really grasp "repudiation", for instance. But the biggest drawback of
STRIDE is that it provides no guidance on how to model threats other than by providing a set of
categories. This means that it relies on the experience and imagination of the person using it, which
can easily lead to missed threats.</p>

<p>DREAD is even worse. Honestly, I have never seen anyone use DREAD in practice. There are far better
impact assessment methodologies now, including the popular Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).
</p>
<p>Our group was able to complete the preparation assignment using Google Docs for collaboration. I
volunteered to present the findings on behalf of the group during the seminar.
</p>
<h4>Technical Challenges</h4>

<p>I am experiencing two very annoying technical challenges. The first is simply the amount of time it
is taking to put together this e-portfolio. Creating the outline was easy enough, but filling in the
content is incredibly time-consuming. For hosting web content, I have long ago become accustomed to
the convenience of content management systems. Unfortunately since we have to host the e-portfolio in
GitHub, we are required to manually hand-code the HTML/CSS pages. In order to reproduce the DREAD
rating table above took me approximately 15 minutes of adding table, row, and data tags. There must
be a better way.</p>

<p>Likewise, I am finding it very frustrating to have to create citations for all of the collaborative
discussion posts. Every citation requires manually copying, pasting, and then transposing the authors'
names, copying and formating the date and title, url, and date accessed. It is a very tedious exercise
which really drains all of the fun from engaging in discussions. Again, there must be a better way.
