                    <p>Hi Sherelle. I appreciate your post and especially some of the more novel mitigations you have suggested.</p>

<p>I think that direct denial of service attacks against medical devices themselves is probably an unlikely
 real world threat. However, attacks that result in denial of service against the controlling systems are 
 already happening. For instance, ransomware attacks against a German hospital in 2020 are believed to have
  accounted for deaths as patients were turned away due to failures of the IT infrastructure (Slabodkin, 2021). </p>

<p>I like your suggestion of using threat detection services to provide early warning of denial of service attacks.
 One potentially interesting mitigation might be the use of honeypots. Honeypots are systems that mimic
  potentially valuable targets, so when an attack is launched against one, it can immediately alert the
   cyber security team. Brook (2016) describes how researchers were able to use honeypots that mimic 
   medical devices to discover numerous attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in those devices. These results 
   could make the case for the use of honeypots in medical environments.</p>

										<p>Hi Ags. I think you are correct regarding your conclusions about mitigating the brute force attacks.
 However, I am not entirely sure if your proposed mitigation against the denial of service would be
  effective in this case.</p>

<p>You have suggested that a network firewall could be an effective control for this type of attack. 
I agree with you that network firewalls can mitigate certain types of denial of service attacks.
 However in order to perform their packet filtering functions, network firewalls need to be located 
 on a network between a potential attacker and the target (Campbell, 2016). In the case of the iStan 
 mannequin, the denial of service attack was conducted using the MDK3 security testing tool
  (Glisson, et. al., 2015). The purpose of MDK3 is to test 802.11 wireless networks (Sankar, 2018).
   Since the attack test took place wirelessly between the attacking system and the access point built
    into the medical mannequin, I do not see how a network firewall could be employed to mitigate the attack.
     I may be mistaken on this point, but I would love to hear if you have any further thoughts on using 
     firewalls to mitigate wireless attacks.</p>

									<h2>Team Assignment</h2>

<p>The team assignment this week was to prepare for seminar 2 on STRIDE and DREAD by assigning DREAD ratings to the vulnerabilities identified
                  in the paper.</p>

										What do we want to accomplish? What skills do we want to develop or refine?
										Goal:
										Completing required assignments as a team.</p>
										
										<p>Skills we want to develop/refine:
										Project management skills:
										Define the project scope to avoid scope creep.
										Stakeholder management - identify all parties involved, and their interest in the project.
										Learning how to apply STRIDE and DREAD methods in practice.
										Information security risk identification and management.
										Team work, including learning to buy into someone else's idea even if it wasn’t one's personal preference.
										Time management and planning skills when working with other people on the project.
									</p>
										
										<p>EXPECTATIONS: What do we expect of one another in regard to attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, the quality of work, etc.?</p>
										
										<p>All members to participate fully in discussions, group assignments and group chats.
										Full attendance at meetings; notifying group members if you cannot attend or will be late.
										Work collaboratively as a team, listening and respecting each other’s ideas.
										Everyone is given an opportunity to contribute, use their experience, skills and ideas throughout the project. No idea/thought is silly and everyone is encouraged to express theirs.</p>
										
										
										<p>POLICIES & PROCEDURES: What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations, such as preparatory tasks, generating ideas, evaluating outcomes? 
										On the first day of each unit team deadlines (both individual team members and overall team ones) are agreed if applicable and documented in a group roadmap document. Where it makes sense, deadlines for future unit work are agreed upon in advance.
										Checklists are created for each assignment related tasks and responsible team members are assigned. Deadlines are specified for each task.
										Weekend before the assignment is due a team meeting is held to finalise the work.
										Everyone must contribute at each stage of the project/assignment. This includes sharing thoughts in group chats, adding research notes to shared group files, etc.
										Team members requiring help on their assigned task must be able to ask for it from their team. This should not be used to score the team member’s performance down in the Peer Assessment.
										Meetings will only be scheduled at times which are between 9am and 9pm local time for each participant.</p>
										
										
										<p>ROLES: Which roles do we need in this project and how do we allocate them? Will there be a project lead?  Is there a need to rotate roles?
										Group leader/facilitator - [Names redacted] (to schedule meetings, update the meeting minutes if applicable, keep an eye on deadlines, track the tasks to completion, do group submissions)</p>
										
										<p>The rest of the group roles will remain flexible and will be addressed on per task/project basis.</p>
										
										
										<p>CONSEQUENCES: How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?  How do we resolve disagreements?
										
										Non-contributing team members will be highlighted in the peer assessment form.
										
										Least contributing team members will be given an opportunity to pick up extra tasks to avoid being scored down on the peer assessment form.
										
										Disagreements on the assignment approach and implementation will be put to vote among the team members. The option with most votes will be the one applied and each team member will be expected to buy into it.</p>
																	
										
										
										<p>By signing this contract, we confirm that:
										we have participated in formulating these goals, expectations, roles, procedures, and consequences as stated in this contact.
										we agree to abide by the contents of this contract

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									<p>First week, and it was announced that this module we would be working in groups. This is both exciting and scary.
										It is exciting because I really do enjoy working with others, 
										especially people from different backgrounds and parts of the world. It is always beneficial to learn from others’ experiences.</p>
									<p>However it is always a bit scary as well because I am aware that I have some personality traits that can cause conflicts in group work.
										At the risk of sounding as though I am making excuses for myself, like many transgender people I was the target of what felt like 
										relentless bullying in public and high school. That experience led me to develop a set of defense mechanisms, most of which have proven 
										unhelpful as an adult. Particularly bothersome for me is a tendency towards - for lack of a better term - “know-it-all-ism”; a need to appear
										smarter than others. It comes from a place of deep insecurity from what I went through as a bullied, queer child and teenager. 
										It caused problems for me the last time I was in an academic group setting, about ten years ago while doing management studies at
										Western University. I will need to continually check myself for this type of behavior.</p>
									<p>Beyond that disclaimer, though, I am looking forward to the module. Our group was provided with no time to waste, and we had only a few
										days to agree on communication channels and get a team contract written and signed. We settled on Google Docs and Zoom to collaborate, 
										and were able to get the contract finished on time.</p>
									<p>We also had to jump right in to a collaborative discussion, reviewing a research paper on attacks against a medical mannequin. This is the
										kind of work that I enjoy most. Wireless attacks are not something that I get a lot of opportunity to research. I found it very
										interesting to work through the paper and do research on the attacks as well as assessing the possibilities for mitigations.</p>
