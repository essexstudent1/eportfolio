                    <p>The problem with wireless security is not an academic one. For instance in 2018, shortly after the attempted 
assassination of an ex-Russan spy in Salisbury involving the use of the nerve agent novichok, four Russian GRU 
agents were discovered attempting to hack into the headquarters of the Organization for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons in The Hague (Greenberg, 2018). The spies had parked a rental car just outside the building, 
filled with sophisticated technical equipment designed to snoop on wi-fi traffic and to spoof a legitimate
 wireless access point in order to carry out a man-in-the-middle attack. </p>

<p>Indeed, hackers need not even have to drive a car. The proliferation of consumer drones has opened up a whole
 new threat vector for wireless attacks. Barker (2020) describes research done to show how an inexpensive drone
  can be fitted with a directional wi-fi antenna and wireless hacking tools. Such a drone could be used to
   compromise wireless networks even within physically secure buildings, with the attackers themselves 
   potentially a mile or more away.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, protecting against wireless attacks is very difficult, as demonstrated by our recent
 collaborative discussion of the proof of concept attacks which Glisson et. al. (2015) carried out
  against a medical mannequin. Many students, such as Ashmore (2022), recommended the use of network
   firewalls as a mitigation. However in order to mitigate threats, network firewalls need to be located 
   on a network between the attacker and the target (Campbell, 2016), which would render them ineffective
    against a wireless attack on a device with a built in wi-fi access point like the iStan. One interesting 
    proposal was the use of built-in signal jamming technology in medical devices which could block wireless 
    connections (Ahmad, 2022). Such a solution, though, may defeat the purpose of wireless connectivity.
</p>
<p>A more promising solution may be the use of mandatory design standards for the security of medical devices.
 Tolofari (2022) points out that there are already international standards for medical devices but these are
  quite old and do not adequately cover cybersecurity. Fortunately in recent years there has been a focus
   on developing new design guidelines for network connected devices including medical devices (Fagan et. al., 2020).
    At this time these guidelines remain voluntary, so the next step should be to build them into a new 
    international standard for cybersecurity design that would be mandatory for all critical medical devices.

									<h2>Team Assignment</h2>

<p>Using your assigned website, carry out the following exercises reporting on the questions listed below.</p>

<p>Perform a basic scan using standard tools such as traceroute (not ICMP version). Use these basic
 tools to compile a list that details the following information:
</p>
<ul><li>How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?</li>
<li>Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that delay?</li>
<li>What are the main nameservers for the website?</li>
<li>Who is the registered contact?</li>
<li>What is the MX record for the website?</li>
<li>Where is the website hosted?</li></ul>
                  
                  
									<div class="box">
										
                    
                    <p>During the Unit 3 we have been asked to perform quick individual scans on the website assigned to our team
 (Group 1): https://loadedwithstuff.co.uk/</p>
 
<p>Our team used a combination of traceroute, tracert, and tracepath to record the number of hops to our destination.
 The number varied between 10 and 15. The hop with the highest latency, presented itself between the middle and
  the end of the traceroute, i.e. between hops 7 and 11 respectively. No lost packets were observed.  </p>
<p>The differences in the hop numbers can be explained by our geographical locations (Fei et al, 1998) and our
 internet providers; our team members have conducted these scans from the UK, Canada, Qatar and Nigeria. 
 The latency differences will be due to the differences between our bandwidth.
Next we were asked to find the mail and name servers for the domain. We used a combination of nslookup and 
web-based tools to identify the name servers below. This indicated to us that the site is being hosted by A2 Hosting.</p>

<ol><li>ns1.a2hosting.com</li>
<li>ns2.a2hosting.com</li>
<li>ns3.a2hosting.com</li>
<li>ns4.a2hosting.com</li></ol>

<p>The MX record for the assigned site was confirmed by everyone to be mail.loadedwithstuff.co.uk.</p>

<p>Next we were asked to provide the registered contact for the domain. Again we used a combination of the whois 
command and various web-based resources. We were able to confirm that the registrar for the site is:</p>

<ul><li>eNom LLC [Tag = ENOM]</li>
<li>URL: http://www.enom.com</li>
</ul>
<p>While contact information for domains used to be public information, this was changed as a result of the 
introduction of the GDPR when the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) agreed to 
start treating this data as personal information that needs to be kept private (Goyal, 2018). </p>
<p>The final part of the scan was to identify the physical location of the server hosting the site. Using a variety 
of web-based IP address geolocation services, we initially suspected that the server was hosted in the USA.
 However, IP address geolocation is not always accurate, especially when considering addresses assigned to 
 Internet companies, which are free to assign their addresses without regard to geography (IPLocation, 2016).
  With this in mind, we looked more closely at the network hops identified in our trace routes. These routes
   all seemed to point to Amsterdam as the correct location. One of our group resides in North America, which
    made their route particularly interesting; if the site was in the USA then their route should be quite short.
     Instead, the route showed a trans-Atlantic hop from Montreal to Liverpool which would not have been necessary 
     if the site was in the USA (Pepelnjak, 2019). Based on all of the evidence available, we concluded that the
      hosting server is most likely located in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Difficulties experienced by the team members were also discussed during the team meeting, and it appears that
 most were due to the lack of hands-on network experience.</p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>This week was the first test of whether the personality traits that I described in unit 1 would be problematic.
As mentioned then, I have a tendency towards "know-it-all-ism", an irrational need to appear smarter than others.
It is a particularly unflattering behaviour pattern.</p>

<p>The topic this week was basic networking, which was a nice refresher for me. I did a lot of network engineering
in the early-to-mid 2000's, and earned the Cisco Certified Network Professional designation, before 
deciding to focus my career on information security. </p>

<p>Most of the questions in this assignment were boringly easy. However the last one - "where is the server
located?" - was a bit more interesting. I love solving a good technical mystery and went to work on it.
I eventually placed the server in Amsterdam, even figuring out which trans-Atlantic submarine cable my packets
most likely traversed (the "Hibernia Express", a new cable that just went into production in 2015). Of course,
I quickly learned that my team members had all just performed a simple IP address geolocation and settled on the 
location as the USA. I had to convince them that my answer was correct -- without being obnoxious about it.
This ended up being a lot harder than I expected. It was my word versus the word of an authoritative-looking
website. Fortunately I was able to win them over, hopefully without coming off as a cad.
</p>
	<p>Finally, we wrapped up the discussion on the medical mannequin vulnerabilities this week. I found this exercise particularly
		enjoyable as it gave me an opportunity to do some research into real-life wireless hacking as well as some theoretical
		research into how consumer drones could be employed in wireless attacks.</p>
										
<h4>Technical Challenges Update</h4>

<p>In my last reflection, I mentioned my challenge with creating references. It occurred to me that maybe there
are browser plug-ins that could do this, so I looked into it a bit and decided to try one out. I settled on
"cite this for me". Unfortunately, the extension is far from perfect and seems unable to find the author's
name. It is helpful, but without the author's name, I still have to perform extra manual steps to create
a reference. I may try a different plugin next week.</p>
