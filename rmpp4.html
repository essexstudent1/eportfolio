									<h2>Seminar 3 Preparation</h2>
									<p>For this week’s seminar, we will review a case study on Privacy. Please read the case below and answer the questions. You need to determine the ethical issues involved with this case. Be prepared to discuss your answers during the session.</p>
																
									<div class="box">
										
                    <p>Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to 
files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical
 portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.</p>

<p>Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain
 properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information
  and for permission to do further study.</p>

<p>Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?</p>

<ol>
<li><p><b>If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?</b></p>
<p>No. Doing so would violate several of the principles of ethical research involving humans, particularly the principle
of informed consent (Vanclay et. al., 2013).</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved</b></p>
 in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?
<p>Again, the primary ethical principle implicated is informed consent. As none of the individuals have provided consent
for their personal information to be used for research purposes, granting access to this data would violate informed consent (Vanclay et. al., 2013).</p></li>
 
 
<li><p><b>Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names
 to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?</b></p>
<p>Assuming that the subjects within the database are within scope of the GDPR, the Records department would first need to 
determine if the request is compliant with Article 89, which lays out the requirements of the research exemption to the
regulation (Mondschein & Monda, 2018). The department would also need to consider the ethical principles of informed consent
and no harm to participants (Vanclay et. al., 2013).</p></li>
 
<li><p><b>Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third
 respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed
  to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?</b></p>
Beth would be limited to contacting only the one third who gave permission. Doing otherwise would violate the principle
of informed consent (Vanclay et. al., 2013).
</ol></li>
