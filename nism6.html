									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2 - Part 3</h2>
									<p>n unit 6, provide a summary of the discussion based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers. This is your `Summary` post. Agree or otherwise, with reasons, with the contributions and reviews made by other students on the topic under discussion, enhancing your original post. </p>

                  <h3>Summary Post</h3>
									                 																
									<div class="box">
																				
                    <p>In groups and individually, we were asked to perform a preliminary scan of our target websites and review 
the results from our peers. Among the answers that we needed to find were the nameservers, mail servers,
 and registration information for the domains. </p>

<p>For the most part, these scans were straight-forward. A typical response was produced by Tolofari (2022) 
which correctly identified these results for the group 2 target website. The question which unexpectedly
 ended up being controversial was finding the physical location of the server hosting the site. Every
  initial post from the other groups which addressed this question placed the server in the USA, often 
  specifically in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This is understandable as most web-based IP address geolocation 
  sites such as geolocation.com and ip2location.com do indeed report the address as belonging to A2 Web Hosting 
  in Ann Arbor. However, our group opted to not take this information as the final word and instead looked 
  closer at our individual traceroutes, reviewing the hops for geographic clues and looking for who appeared 
  to have trans-Atlantic hops and who did not. As a result we finally agreed that the most likely physical
   location for the server is Amsterdam, Netherlands (Angelides, 2022).</p>

<p>What I found most interesting about this topic was the reaction from others towards our group’s answer to 
this question. Rather than re-evaluating their own previous conclusions, responders challenged ours.
 Klacar (2022) argued that IP address geolocation should be considered reliable at least at the country level, 
 and Jurbe (2022) suggested that because the autonomous system number (ASN) associated with the target network
  block is assigned to A2 Web Hosting in the USA, the site is most likely in the USA. </p>

<p>While this debate is something of a teapot-based tempest, I believe that it has some important lessons. 
Cybercriminals routinely use stealth technology such as Tor, the dark web, and overlay networks to evade 
detection and attribution (Campbell, 2016). To succeed against these deceptive threats, Sanders (2016) argues 
that curiosity, and the desire to uncover the truth beyond initial appearances, is a critical factor for
 success in cybersecurity. </p>

									<h2>Team Assignment</h2>

<p>You will need to initially submit a design document to your client which covers the following requirements. 
Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside 
the criteria grid (Module Resources). </p>

<ul><li>Identify the appropriate governing body and associated regulations that apply to your assigned site (consider who will use it, the kind of information it contains/ displays, the industry it belongs to and the functionality it offers). (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 25%)</li>
<li>Create a list of possible security vulnerabilities, as determined by the regulations identified above. (Application of Knowledge weighted at 25%)</li>
<li>Create a summary list of recommendations and potential mitigations that could be used to ameliorate the risks you identified. Note that these are theoretical risks, there is no requirement to perform any scans or tests on the site at this time. These should be ordered by the level of potential risk to the organisation that could (or would) own the site. (Criticality weighted at 25%)</li>
<li>Presentation and Structure of your work (weighted at 25%) includes spelling, style, evidence of proofreading, correct use (and format) of citations and references.</li></ul>

               <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Loaded With Stuff! (loadedwithstuff.co.uk) is an e-commerce site offering two payment options: outright 
purchases and ‘Easy Financing’ program. It targets customers looking for the newest technology from known brands.
 In this report, the authors will describe the system, identify the security and privacy compliance requirements 
 which apply to it, and provide a prioritised list of potential vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations.</p>
 
<h3>System Description</h3>

<p>Loaded With Stuff! was built with the Softaculous automated deployment system and is based on Loaded Commerce
 Community Edition v6.6. It is located at the A2 Web Hosting data centre in Amsterdam on a shared hosting 
 server with IP address 68.66.247.187. The loadedwithstuff.co.uk domain name is registered through eNom LLC.</p>
 
<p>The website collects and stores data, some of which is considered personal, to be able to process the orders,
 such as: email address, delivery and billing addresses, phone numbers.</p>
 
<p>The website does not handle or store any cardholder data (CHD) and the payment page has instead been outsourced 
to a third party.</p>

<p>The ‘Easy financing’ finance program appears to be outsourced to an external provider and, thus, it is out 
of scope of this design document.</p>

<h3>Governing Regulations</h3>

<p>The Loaded with Stuff! website belongs to a UK domain; however, the web server is being hosted in 
the Netherlands (Group 1, 2022). Thus, the governing bodies and the regulations from both the UK 
and Netherlands were shortlisted as those applicable to the Loaded With Stuff! website:</p>

										<h3>Security Vulnerabilities & Mitigations</h3>

<p>The theoretical security vulnerabilities relevant to the above list of identified regulations have been 
prepared using STRIDE methodology and can be viewed below, where each vulnerability has been assigned to a
 STRIDE (Microsoft, 2022) category (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service,
  Elevation of Privilege) and ordered by business priority. The recommendations have also been prepared 
  for each identified security weakness.</p>
  
<p>The hosting provider for the site, A2, provides a number of common security mitigations to all customers,
 including DDoS protection, firewalls, brute force defense, and virus scanning (A2 Web Hosting, 2022).
  These mitigations are not included in the table below as they are assumed to already be implemented.
Business priority has been determined based on each vulnerability’s DREAD risk ranking (University of 
Essex Online, 2022):</p>

<ul><li>DREAD 0 (no risk), 1 (low risk) - low business priority.</li>
<li>DREAD 2 (medium risk) - medium business priority.</li>
<li>DREAD 3 (high risk) - high business priority.</li></ul>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>This was not my finest week, at least not in the collaborative discussion. As I mentioned last week, 
I was losing patience a bit and this week I clearly lost it. </p>

<p>I stand by the premise of my summary post, which is that cyber attackers often employ stealth and
 redirection in order to obfuscate their origins and hide their tracks, and therefore cybersecurity
  biases are getting in their way. However I was feeling rushed and stressed-out, and did not think
   through how I should communicate these thoughts. What came out was condescending and insulting,
    and I was mortified when I re-read it the next day.</p>

<p>I hate making excuses for myself, but I do think it is fair to point out that I am feeling under a 
lot of pressure right now. Also, at the risk of being TMI, I am into month four of transgender hormone 
replacement therapy, and my emotions are a complete rollercoaster ride. Transitioning while working
 full-time and taking a postgraduate degree was not the best idea. Although, to be fair, when I started
  working on applying for this program last June, I had no intention of transitioning. That only happened
   after intense therapy in the early fall, after I had already gotten funding and been accepted into the
    program. Going forward, I think I just need to check myself more, especially when posting in collaborative
     discussions.</p>

<p>The better news this week is that we completed our team design document assignment. It took a marathon
Zoom collaboration session on Sunday, but I feel like we did a pretty good job overall. The hardest part 
of this was completing the peer review. I was a bit disappointed that some of the team members were not
 contributing as much as the rest. For instance, we had all agreed that we would each contribute 3 vulnerabilities
  to the report and would then pare them down based on the word count. That should have given us 15 vulnerabilities 
  to work with, but we only had 10 and it was clear that at least one person had not contributed any data.
   I ended up looking through the edit history in Google Docs to see who had contributed what to the document
    and based my peer reviews largely on that.</p>

<p>Anyway, we’re now passed the half-way point in this course, so must keep working away!</p>
