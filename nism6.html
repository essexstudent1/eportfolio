									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2 - Part 3</h2>
									<p>n unit 6, provide a summary of the discussion based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers. This is your `Summary` post. Agree or otherwise, with reasons, with the contributions and reviews made by other students on the topic under discussion, enhancing your original post. </p>

                  <h3>Summary Post</h3>
									                 																
									<div class="box">
																				
                    <p>In groups and individually, we were asked to perform a preliminary scan of our target websites and review 
the results from our peers. Among the answers that we needed to find were the nameservers, mail servers,
 and registration information for the domains. </p>

<p>For the most part, these scans were straight-forward. A typical response was produced by Tolofari (2022) 
which correctly identified these results for the group 2 target website. The question which unexpectedly
 ended up being controversial was finding the physical location of the server hosting the site. Every
  initial post from the other groups which addressed this question placed the server in the USA, often 
  specifically in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This is understandable as most web-based IP address geolocation 
  sites such as geolocation.com and ip2location.com do indeed report the address as belonging to A2 Web Hosting 
  in Ann Arbor. However, our group opted to not take this information as the final word and instead looked 
  closer at our individual traceroutes, reviewing the hops for geographic clues and looking for who appeared 
  to have trans-Atlantic hops and who did not. As a result we finally agreed that the most likely physical
   location for the server is Amsterdam, Netherlands (Angelides, 2022).</p>

<p>What I found most interesting about this topic was the reaction from others towards our group’s answer to 
this question. Rather than re-evaluating their own previous conclusions, responders challenged ours.
 Klacar (2022) argued that IP address geolocation should be considered reliable at least at the country level, 
 and Jurbe (2022) suggested that because the autonomous system number (ASN) associated with the target network
  block is assigned to A2 Web Hosting in the USA, the site is most likely in the USA. </p>

<p>While this debate is something of a teapot-based tempest, I believe that it has some important lessons. 
Cybercriminals routinely use stealth technology such as Tor, the dark web, and overlay networks to evade 
detection and attribution (Campbell, 2016). To succeed against these deceptive threats, Sanders (2016) argues 
that curiosity, and the desire to uncover the truth beyond initial appearances, is a critical factor for
 success in cybersecurity. </p>

                  <h3>Personal Reponse</h3>
                  <p>The day after posting my summary post, I added a reply.</p>														
									<div class="box">
                  <p>I just re-read this and realized that it comes across as condescending. I am sorry. That was not my intention. I wanted to make a point that security professionals should be constantly questioning everything. I was feeling rushed while writing and clearly chose my words poorly. </p>
                  
                  </div>

									<h2>Team Assignment</h2>

<p>You will need to initially submit a design document to your client which covers the following requirements. 
Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside 
the criteria grid (Module Resources). </p>

<ul><li>Identify the appropriate governing body and associated regulations that apply to your assigned site (consider who will use it, the kind of information it contains/ displays, the industry it belongs to and the functionality it offers). (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 25%)</li>
<li>Create a list of possible security vulnerabilities, as determined by the regulations identified above. (Application of Knowledge weighted at 25%)</li>
<li>Create a summary list of recommendations and potential mitigations that could be used to ameliorate the risks you identified. Note that these are theoretical risks, there is no requirement to perform any scans or tests on the site at this time. These should be ordered by the level of potential risk to the organisation that could (or would) own the site. (Criticality weighted at 25%)</li>
<li>Presentation and Structure of your work (weighted at 25%) includes spelling, style, evidence of proofreading, correct use (and format) of citations and references.</li></ul>

<p>At the end of the week, you will also need to submit your peer assessment form, available in the Module Resources page.  Please see guidelines on the Department’s website  (Group/Teamwork). </p>

<h4>Metasploit</h4>
<ul><li>Easy to install (just lots of next for windows, and for kali linux it’s just a command line)</li>
<li>Ease of use - you just call the function, set destination and the host</li>
<li>Flexibility - scan, build virus, password crackers, DOS, etc. Supports many OS. High risk because it makes the machine vulnerable. </li>
<li>Licensing - open source, some libraries or sources are inbuilt and they are sold on dark web. About 20-10% of libraries, sources are charged.</li>
<li>Reputation - the tool is well known for a long time. It is good for offensive hacking/pen testing. The companies do not use it publicly as it’s a dangerous tool.</li>
<li>Privacy - Hamad thinks that it is hard to prove that the software is not sharing any of your machine data during the scans. </li></ul>

<h4>Nessus</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of install - easy to install.</li>
<li>Ease of use - you set up the host name/IP and scan.</li>
<li>Flexibility - extra steps to go through if you have cloud deployments. It’s more difficult to customise</li>
<li>Licensing - they charge, but they offer a trial month (with limited reports).</li>
<li>Reputation - known tool. </li>
<li>Privacy - privacy documents in place to ensure your data is secure.</li></ul>

<h4>Nmap</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of install - easy.</li>
<li>Ease of use - CLI based, it’s harder to use because you need to know the commands.</li>
<li>Flexibility - not customisable.</li>
<li>Licensing - free.</li>
<li>Reputation - very well know.</li>
<li>Privacy - local installation is very safe, everything is stored on your machine. Online privacy is unknown, i.e. we don’t know if they keep the reports or email it to someone -  we cannot prove it is 100% confidential. Most people tend to use online version, so your IP is not exposed.</li></ul>

<h4>Burp</h4>
<ul><li>Easy installation</li>
<li>Ease of use - local certificate must be generated, imported into the browser you wish to use so that everything is cached on your machine. More for experienced users.</li>
<li>Licensing - free and paid version (pro and enterprise). Pro is not very expensive, but the enterprise is very pricey.</li>
<li>Privacy - the tool is installed on your machine, so as long as you keep your machine safe, the data is safe.</li></ul>

<h4>OWASP</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of install - easy</li>
<li>Ease of use - easy to use.</li>
<li>Flexibility - supports many OS. It is open source; developers can change the source code to suit their needs. Both manual and auto scanning allowed.</li>
<li>Privacy - plugins may be unsecure, some code could be manipulated.</li>
<li>https://www.peerspot.com/products/owasp-zap-reviews</li></ul>

<h4>SQLmap</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of use - Linux and need to know commands.</li>
<li>Flexibility - it supports all types of databases, except non-SQL based.</li>
<li>Licensing - open source</li>
<li>Reputation - well reviewed in the IT community</li>
<li>Privacy - open source, installed locally</li></ul>

<h4>Kali linux</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of install - Abidemi had issues installing it on her machine</li>
<li>Ease of use - requires Linux command line use</li>
<li>Flexibility - customizable, just not easy to do.</li>
<li>Licensing - free, although some custom paid apps, but the main suite is free of charge.</li>
<li>Privacy - it can come packed with viruses, worms, etc</li></ul>

<h4>Jawfish</h4>
<ul><li>Ease of use - python knowledge needed for some things, they do offer free training</li>
<li>Flexibility - customisable with pyton</li>
<li>Licensing - free</li>
<li>Reputation - open source, fairly new, not as popular</li>
<li>Privacy - open source, not much more known.</li></ul>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>In the collaborative discussion, I started to lose my patience a bit. Our group was the only group who
correctly (in my not-so-humble opinion) located the server. Yet the responses that we recieved to our
post just questioned our conclusion. It brought to mind that cognitive bias where you latch on to the first
bit of information you read, even if that information is wrong. And if it is wrong, it will take a mountain
of evidence to convince you. You can't escape cognitive biases; they are innate. I am full of them.
But you can try to lower the impact of them by realizing when you have gotten trapped by one. So I decided
to make a post to that effect.</p>

<p>For our seminar prep this week, we had to read up on and rate penetration testing tools. I have used most
of these tools at one time or another in the past, so this was a refresher for me. We also continued working
on our unit 6 design document. We have many pages of raw notes, and have a skeleton for the final deliverable.
We have agreed that we will all contribute 3 vulnerabilties to the document, and then we can pare them
down based on word count.</p>

<h4>Technical Challenges Update
</h4>
<p>There was no way that I was going to hand-code all of the HTML tags required for the table and all of the 
bulleted lists in this post. I had to find something. And I found it! It is a lightweight text editor
called Bluefish. It allows you to just highlight some text, and click a button to add tags around the text.
It is not the ideal solution, but it is the best one I have found so far.
</p>
<p>I am still struggling with the auto citation generator.</p>
