								  <ul>
								    <li>Introduce the concept of exploratory and descriptive research designs.</li>
								    <li>Introduce 3 research methods – quantitative, qualitative and mixed method research - as well as primary and secondary research methods, and the data collection methods associated with each one.</li>
								    
								   </ul>
									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 - Part 3</h2>
									<p>Continue with the Unit 1 Discussion forum. You should now provide a summary post into to the discussion in Unit 1 based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers.</p>

										<h3>Initial Post</h3>	
										<p>In my original post, I agreed with the findings of the Rogue ISP case study that the malware authors acted ethically in disrupting Rogue’s operations (My-course.co.uk., 2023a). In her peer response, Andrea Paolo Gussoni points out that the impacts of cyber attacks are difficult to measure (My-course.co.uk., 2023b). She also draws attention to the fact that technology companies can be complicit in state crimes. Such ethical dilemmas certainly carry on even today, with Cisco’s help in building censorship infrastructure for repressive states being a primary example (Cope, 2016). However I would suggest that this type of ethical problem is not particularly relevant to the case study which concerns the disruption of a rogue web hosting provider.</p>

<p>One interesting question which arose from other discussions on this case study is whether security vendors should be expected to determine the most ethical way to disrupt a rogue actor. For instance, a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack may have been equally disruptive without doing any permanent damage to innocent parties (Schneier, 2016). Building a sort of ethical framework to help make decisions on disrupting malicious operations may be a useful topic for future research. </p>
