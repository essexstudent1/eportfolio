								  <h2>Objectives</h2>
								  <ul>
								    <li>Introduce the concept of exploratory and descriptive research designs.</li>
								    <li>Introduce 3 research methods – quantitative, qualitative and mixed method research - as well as primary and secondary research methods, and the data collection methods associated with each one.</li>
								    
								   </ul>
									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 - Part 3</h2>
									<p>Continue with the Unit 1 Discussion forum. You should now provide a summary post into to the discussion in Unit 1 based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers.</p>

										<h3>Summary Post</h3>	
										<p>In my original post, I agreed with the findings of the Rogue ISP case study that the malware authors acted ethically in disrupting Rogue’s operations (My-course.co.uk., 2023a). In her peer response, Andrea Paolo Gussoni points out that the impacts of cyber attacks are difficult to measure (My-course.co.uk., 2023b). She also draws attention to the fact that technology companies can be complicit in state crimes. Such ethical dilemmas certainly carry on even today, with Cisco’s help in building censorship infrastructure for repressive states being a primary example (Cope, 2016). However I would suggest that this type of ethical problem is not particularly relevant to the case study which concerns the disruption of a rogue web hosting provider.</p>

<p>One interesting question which arose from other discussions on this case study is whether security vendors should be expected to determine the most ethical way to disrupt a rogue actor. For instance, a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack may have been equally disruptive without doing any permanent damage to innocent parties (Schneier, 2016). Building a sort of ethical framework to help make decisions on disrupting malicious operations may be a useful topic for future research. </p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
										
										<ol>
<li><h4>What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?</h4>
<p>The topic is "Implementing Cyber Security tools and/or techniques in the reduction of cyberbullying". The aim is to 
determine the current state of cyber security practices in the reduction of cyberbullying, assess their effectiveness,
and make recommendations for improvement.</p></li>


<li><h4>Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?</h4>
<p>Cyberbullying is a significant threat to society. It hurts both children and adults, and contributes to 
a less honest and open society. Cyber security can play a role in reducing this threat.</p></li>



<h4>What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you use to synthesise the literature?</h4>
<p>TBD once I have done some initial research.</p>


<li><h4>How did you locate and select sources for inclusion in the review?</h4>
<p>I plan to start with the Essex library. I also plan to use Google and Consensus to find appropriate academic articles. I will
additionally use the references lists within articles to locate further papers.</p></li>



<h4>How is your review structured?</h4>
<p>This question will be a focus area for me this coming week. I need to better understand how literature reviews
tend to be structured. I am unclear whether the main point is to focus on the current state of research into a question
or the current state of the topic itself.</p>



<li><h4>What are the main findings in the literature on this topic? </h4>
<p>TBD once I have done some initial research.</p></li>



<li><h4>What are the main strengths and limitations of this literature? </h4>
<p>TBD once I have done some initial research.</p></li>



<li><h4>Are there any discrepancies in this literature? </h4>
<p>TBD once I have done some initial research.</p></li>



<li><h4>What conclusions do your draw from the review? What do you argue needs to be done as an outcome of the review?</h4>
<p>TBD once I have done some initial research.</p></li>
