									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
									
                  <h3>Discussion Topic - Case Study: Accuracy of information</h3>
<p>Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.</p>

<p>Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”</p>

<h3>Ethical Concerns</h3>

<ul><li>Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?</li>
<li>Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?</li>
<li>Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?</li>
<li>If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?</li>
<li>You should also highlight legal, social and professional impacts of any choices made. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers here and you may introduce local, as well as international, legislature in your responses.</li></ul>

<p>You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals, books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and your summary post is required in your e-portfolio.</p>

                    							<h2>Initial Post</h2>

<p>There are few things in human existence which have more potential to affect health and well-being than food. As one example, studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet has numerous health benefits, including reduced risk of various cancers, lower occurrence of obesity, lower risk of diabetes and heart disease, and less risk of dementia (Dernini et al., 2017). </p>

<p>The vital importance of nutrition means that nutritional research can have long term impacts on entire nations, for better or for worse. When nutritional researchers manipulate findings to suit special interests, the effects can be catastrophic. One of the most infamous examples was the Seven Countries Study, published in the 1960’s by Ancel Keys (Leslie, 2016). The study purported to prove that the primary cause of heart disease was the consumption of animal fats. Later critique suggested that Keys had been selective in his choice of subjects and methods in order to arrive at the conclusion that he wanted. However, this criticism came too late, as multiple governments and medical associations used the study to advocate for a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. The result of these policies has been an epidemic of obesity in Western countries, largely as a result of the increased consumption of carbohydrates (Faruque et al., 2019).</p>

<p>It is particularly important to ensure an ethical approach to research when that research is funded by industry, as is the case with Abi (Rucker & Rucker, 2016). To that end, the
International Life Sciences Institute published a set of guidelines for industry-funded research, the first of which requires that researchers must let the research lead them to conclusions, rather than working towards a desired outcome (IUFoST Scientific Information Bulletin, 2012). According to this guideline, it would be unethical for Abi to manipulate his research methods for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion which would be favourable to the manufacturer. Abi should also consider making all of the data from his research available to other researchers for independent verification (Rucker & Rucker, 2016).</p>

										<h3>Assessing the role of cyber security tools and practices in the reduction of cyberbullying</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In recent years, the rise of social networking sites and other online platforms has led to an alarming increase in cyberbullying. A recent survey in the USA found that nearly a quarter of all teens reported having been cyberbullied in the previous month, with significantly higher percentages for transgender and other LGBTQ youth (Hinduja, 2021).</p>
<p>As cyberbullying has become more prevalent, researchers and practitioners have increasingly turned to cyber security tools and practices as a means of mitigating its effects. Despite the growing interest in cyber security tools and practices as a means of reducing cyberbullying, there is still much to be learned about their effectiveness. This paper aims to explore the role of cyber security tools and practices in the reduction of cyberbullying. Specifically, it will examine the effectiveness of various cyber security tools and practices and identify areas for further research and development.</p>
<p>By shedding light on the role of cyber security tools and practices in the reduction of cyberbullying, this paper aims to contribute to the development of more effective strategies for combating this pervasive problem.</p>
<h4>Cyberbullying and its impacts</h4>
<p>Cyberbullying is typically defined as the use of networked technology to harass, threaten, or hurt others. Cyberbullying can encompass many types of online activities, including sending threatening messages, spreading rumors, and posting embarrassing or compromising content online. Smith & Steffgen (2013) found that the defining features of cyberbullying include:</p>
<ul><li>malicious intent of the offender, </li>
<li>a power imbalance between the offender and victim, often exacerbated by anonymity, and</li>
<li>repetition of the offending acts over time.</li></ul>
<p>The consequences of cyberbullying can be devastating, leading to emotional distress, anxiety, depression, social isolation, suicide ideation, and self-harm. These effects are particularly profound for LGBTQ youth, who are four times more likely to experience severe cyberbullying than non-LGBTQ youth (Hamm et al., 2015).</p>

<h4>Approaches to the use of cyber security tools for cyberbullying</h4>
<p>The term cyberbullying was coined in the early 2000’s as social networking sites first emerged on the Internet, and early research into this area focused on the role of parents and educators in manual monitoring and intervention (Henson, 2012). However, manual processes were never going to scale effectively as social networking became more ubiquitous, and research conducted in 2014 found that 67 percent of students surveyed believed that no solution existed which could reduce the problem of cyberbullying (Parris et al., 2014).  </p>
<p>Cyber security refers to the tools, processes, and practices employed to protect information technology systems and networks from malicious attack (Hibberd, 2022). Within this context, Zambrano et al. (2021) applied various cyber threat models to the cyberbullying life cycle to argue that cyberbullying should be seen and treated as a cyber attack. If cyberbullying can be classified as a cyber attack, then the application of cyber security practices may be an effective means to mitigate cyberbullying. </p>
<p>A popular model for cyber security is the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. The framework defines five core cyber security functions; identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover (National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2018). This paper will review the existing research within this area as it applies to the functions of protection, detection, and response.</p>
<h4>Literature Review</h4>
<p><b>Protect</b></p>
<p>In cyber security, the protect function aims to prevent successful attacks or at least minimize their potential likelihood and impact. Research into the use of cyber security tools to prevent cyberbullying has been relatively scarce. Some researchers have focused on the use of cyber security and privacy awareness training to help individuals protect themselves against cyberbullying. Zorlu (2022) conducted a study of college students and found a moderate correlation between cybersecurity awareness and cyberbullying awareness, but admitted that the findings could simply indicate that victims of cyberbullying tend to be motivated towards educating themselves on cybersecurity.  </p>
<p>One innovative approach to prevention is based on the power imbalance aspect of cyberbullying. Lowry et al. (2017) suggested that system developers could use specific IT design features to change the control balance between bullies and victims. These features include deindividuation, which makes it more difficult to target individuals for bullying, and positive accountability, which assigns escalating sanctions to users based on bullying behaviors. The researchers used a factorial survey method to test their design and found support for some underlying aspects of their theory. </p>
<p><b>Detect</b></p>
<p>Of the three cyber security functions discussed in this paper, detection has garnered the most interest from researchers. Early work in this area focused on the use of dictionaries of offensive words, occasionally coupled with some additional factors such as demographic information (Al-garadi et al., 2016). However, these initial approaches only served to demonstrate the significant challenges of computer-based cyberbullying detection, which include:</p>
<ul><li>The continually evolving nature of online communication, such as the use of acronyms, code words, and emoticons (Al-garadi et al., 2016).</li>
<li>The multi-lingual nature of many online users (Van Hee et al., 2018).</li>
<li>The use of images and videos as part of cyberbullying (Mkhize et al., 2020).</li>
<li>The need to factor in the main identifying criterias of cyberbullying; malicious intent, repetition, and a power imbalance (Smith & Steffgen, 2013).</li></ul>

<p>One of the first studies to employ machine learning techniques to overcome these challenges was Al-garadi et al. (2016). Al-garadi and team tested four different machine learning algorithms on a random sample of 10,000 messages out of a dataset of 2.5 million messages harvested from Twitter. They found that the random forest algorithm combined with synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was the best performer with a positive detection rate of 71.4 percent and a false positive rate of 0.6 percent.</p>
<p>Van Hee et al. (2018) published a similar study, although additionally coding their samples based on the behaviors of bystanders, both those that defend the victim and those that aid the bully. Their study included datasets in both English and Dutch, demonstrating that a machine learning detection approach can produce favourable results in multiple languages.</p>
<p>Since then, researchers continued to improve upon these results with sophisticated new machine learning techniques. An early study on deep learning compared four different algorithms and found that Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) produced the best detection results (Iwendi et al., 2020). Later, Paul & Saha (2022) demonstrated that the deep learning system Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) could out-perform previous machine learning approaches to cyberbullying detection. </p>
<p>Other recent studies have focused on hyperparameter optimization within deep learning algorithms to further improve results. Albraikan et al. (2022) took this approach to develop an innovative method based on Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Neural Network (BiGRNN) with an accuracy of over 92 percent. Al Duhayyim et al. (2022) used Teacher Learning Genetic Optimization (TLGO) for hyperparameter tuning to achieve similar accuracy.</p>
<p>While these studies provide hope that deep learning cyber security tools can be used to accurately detect cyberbullying, there have been some papers which urge caution. Gencoglu (2021) points out that machines can learn and propagate biases, and suggests fairness constraints which should be introduced into learning algorithms. Other research has shown that machine learning-based detection systems can be subject to adversarial attacks aimed at either poisoning the training data or evading detection (Cresci et al., 2021).</p>

<p><b>Respond</b></p>
<p>While much has been written on how to use cyber security tools to detect cyberbullying, less attention has been given to how to respond to it once detected. Arif (2021) proposes that a cyberbullying detection system could trigger an automated mental health monitoring system. Deteriorations in the victim’s mental health could then trigger alerts to family, medical providers, or law enforcement. </p>
<p>There have additionally been some studies on the use of fully automated intervention. Gabrielli et al. (2020) tested a chatbot designed to provide mental health support for youth, which could be deployed in response to a detected cyberbullying incident, and found that 76 percent of test subjects found the intervention system useful. A similar study, based on the theory that bystanders can play a significant role in mitigating the impacts of cyberbullying, proposed a chatbot which could ‘hijack’ user accounts within a chat to defend the victim (Ueda et al., 2021). However, such a system would likely fall afoul of privacy regulations.</p>
<h4>Analysis </h4>
<p><b>Traditional approaches to combating cyberbullying</b></p>
<p>To assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity tools and practices, it may be helpful to first consider the degree to which traditional approaches have been successful. Traditional strategies have included:</p>

<ol><li>School-based prevention programs aimed at increasing resilience in potential victims and empathy in potential bullies (Wölfer et al., 2014). </li>
<li>Having parents and teachers monitor online behavior, and encouraging victims to inform a parent or teacher when they are being cyberbullied (Slonje et al., 2013).</li>
<li>Restricting the amount of time that youth are permitted to use the Internet or mobile technology (Selwyn & Aagaard, 2021).</li></ol>

<p>The effectiveness of these strategies has been mixed. For instance, Slonje et al. (2013) found that victims of cyberbullying were less likely to report incidents to a parent or teacher than victims of physical bullying. School-based programs have been found to be more successful. Wölfer et al. (2014) used a pretest-posttest design to measure the middle-school program “Media Heroes” and found that the long version reduced cyberbullying by 19 percent. However, the success of school programs may be short-lived if they are not carried on through secondary and post-secondary education (Myers & Cowie, 2019).</p>

<p><b>Cyber security approaches to combating cyberbullying</b></p>
<p>The literature indicates that some cyber security tools have the potential to reduce cyberbullying. A significant body of research has shown that deep learning systems can be very effective at detecting cyberbullying. However, all research reviewed on this topic has taken place in a research setting using pre-existing corpuses of messages. To determine their effectiveness at combating cyberbullying online, these systems should be tested and implemented online. Most cyberbullying occurs on major social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok (Navarro et al., 2017), but can also occur on a plethora of other technology platforms such as text messaging, instant messaging, and online game chat. Even an artificial intelligence-driven detection system with perfect accuracy will be entirely ineffective if it cannot be deployed to detect cyberbullying where and when it happens.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the largely unregulated, or self-regulated, nature of social platforms makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of anti-cyberbullying mechanisms they have deployed (Milosevic, 2017). Still more worrying is recent reporting suggesting that one of the largest social networking sites, Twitter, has been actively dismantling their anti-harassment capabilities (Spring, 2023). </p>
<p>The outcome of this analysis indicates that cyber security tools have the potential to become effective tools in the fight against cyberbullying, but more work needs to be done if they are to fulfill this potential.</p>
<h4>Further Research</h4>
<p>To address the concerns described above, future research should focus on the challenges of deploying cyber security anti-cyberbullying tools within the technology ecosystems where cyberbullying occurs. Additional work should also consider how new advances in generative artificial intelligence could be used to develop improved intervention chatbots for responding to incidents.</p>
<p>Another potential approach for future study would be the blending of traditional and cyber security approaches. The literature indicates that traditional school-based intervention programs can be effective at preventing cyberbullying, but are less effective at detecting and responding to incidents when they do occur. On the other hand, cyber security tools show less potential to prevent incidents but more potential to detect and respond to them. Research should be carried out to determine how these different approaches could be merged into holistic anti-cyberbullying solutions.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Cyberbullying is a significant social and technical problem which can seriously impact the mental and physical health of victims, and which can be particularly devastating for those in the most vulnerable populations such as transgender and other LGBTQ+ youth.</p>
<p>Recent research demonstrates that cyber security tools and practices hold the promise of advancements in the fight against cyberbullying. However, it is a promise that has yet to be delivered on. </p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
								<p>I managed to submit my literature review assignment this week, but I honestly have no idea whether I did well on it or not. In thinking about this, I feel like the entire Master’s program perhaps has a big gap in it related to understanding assignments and expectations. I consistently received good grades, which I count as a B or better, on all of my assignments through the majority of my modules. However, that all changed in my last module, Principles of Digital Forensics and Cyber Law. I felt that I actually put a lot more effort into that module than I did in previous modules, only to see my grades drop significantly. It felt like someone had moved the goalposts on me without telling me. It may have just been that one tutor; a lot of other students also mentioned that they were disappointed with their grades. However I can’t shake the feeling that the goalposts did actually move and I wasn’t told. In which case, I could end up failing this assignment – not for lack of trying or understanding the material, but simply for not understanding the expectations for the assignment.</p>
								
								<p>We spend a lot of time in this program looking at the subject matter of the modules, but almost no time discussing academic expectations. It seems like it is assumed that students know what is expected in an “expert report” vs a “literature review” vs anything else. However, I am in my 50s and it has been a long, long time since I last did any academic work. It would be very nice if the program spent a bit more time preparing students for developing assignments.</p>
