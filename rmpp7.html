								  <h2>Objectives</h2>
								  <ul>
								    <li>Introduce the concepts of validity, generalisability and reliability and how they impact on your research design.</li>
								    <li>Consider the differences between qualitative and quantitative data and how to analyse and present your results.</li>
								   
								   </ul>
									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
									
                  <h3>Discussion Topic - Case Study: Accuracy of information</h3>
<p>Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.</p>

<p>Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”</p>

<h3>Ethical Concerns</h3>

<ul><li>Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?</li>
<li>Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?</li>
<li>Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?</li>
<li>If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?</li>
<li>You should also highlight legal, social and professional impacts of any choices made. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers here and you may introduce local, as well as international, legislature in your responses.</li></ul>

<p>You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals, books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and your summary post is required in your e-portfolio.</p>

                    							<h2>Initial Post</h2>

<p>There are few things in human existence which have more potential to affect health and well-being than food. As one example, studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet has numerous health benefits, including reduced risk of various cancers, lower occurrence of obesity, lower risk of diabetes and heart disease, and less risk of dementia (Dernini et al., 2017). </p>

<p>The vital importance of nutrition means that nutritional research can have long term impacts on entire nations, for better or for worse. When nutritional researchers manipulate findings to suit special interests, the effects can be catastrophic. One of the most infamous examples was the Seven Countries Study, published in the 1960’s by Ancel Keys (Leslie, 2016). The study purported to prove that the primary cause of heart disease was the consumption of animal fats. Later critique suggested that Keys had been selective in his choice of subjects and methods in order to arrive at the conclusion that he wanted. However, this criticism came too late, as multiple governments and medical associations used the study to advocate for a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. The result of these policies has been an epidemic of obesity in Western countries, largely as a result of the increased consumption of carbohydrates (Faruque et al., 2019).</p>

<p>It is particularly important to ensure an ethical approach to research when that research is funded by industry, as is the case with Abi (Rucker & Rucker, 2016). To that end, the
International Life Sciences Institute published a set of guidelines for industry-funded research, the first of which requires that researchers must let the research lead them to conclusions, rather than working towards a desired outcome (IUFoST Scientific Information Bulletin, 2012). According to this guideline, it would be unethical for Abi to manipulate his research methods for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion which would be favourable to the manufacturer. Abi should also consider making all of the data from his research available to other researchers for independent verification (Rucker & Rucker, 2016).</p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
								<p>I managed to submit my literature review assignment this week, but I honestly have no idea whether I did well on it or not. In thinking about this, I feel like the entire Master’s program perhaps has a big gap in it related to understanding assignments and expectations. I consistently received good grades, which I count as a B or better, on all of my assignments through the majority of my modules. However, that all changed in my last module, Principles of Digital Forensics and Cyber Law. I felt that I actually put a lot more effort into that module than I did in previous modules, only to see my grades drop significantly. It felt like someone had moved the goalposts on me without telling me. It may have just been that one tutor; a lot of other students also mentioned that they were disappointed with their grades. However I can’t shake the feeling that the goalposts did actually move and I wasn’t told. In which case, I could end up failing this assignment – not for lack of trying or understanding the material, but simply for not understanding the expectations for the assignment.</p>
								
								<p>We spend a lot of time in this program looking at the subject matter of the modules, but almost no time discussing academic expectations. It seems like it is assumed that students know what is expected in an “expert report” vs a “literature review” vs anything else. However, I am in my 50s and it has been a long, long time since I last did any academic work. It would be very nice if the program spent a bit more time preparing students for developing assignments.</p>
