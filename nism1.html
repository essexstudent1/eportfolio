										<h3>Initial Post</h3>	
										<p>Glisson et. al. (2015) explain that cyber attacks against medical devices have been accelerating, and they describe their experiments with attempting to compromise a medical training mannequin to determine if these devices are vulnerable to attack. In this post, we will explore the threats and vulnerabilities discussed in their report and how these might be mitigated. A threat is something or someone that could cause a security incident, and a vulnerability is a control weakness or gap that could be exploited by a threat (Campbell, 2016).</p>

										<p>In their paper, Glisson et. al. do not describe any actual threats that may wish to cause a security incident with respect to the medical mannequin. At most they mention that the FBI and other groups have released notifications about threats to medical devices, but beyond this they focus only on vulnerabilities. The two specific vulnerabilities explored in the paper are weaknesses in Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) and susceptibility to denial of service attacks.</p>

										<p>The iStan medical mannequin has its own wireless network access port which implements WPS. Viehböck (2011) explains that WPS suffers from two design flaws which makes it vulnerable to brute force attacks. Glisson et. al. used the Reaver security testing tool to successfully compromise the iStan in both physical and virtual modes using this attack method. Mitigating this vulnerability is very difficult. Viehböck recommends disabling WPS. However, WPS is implemented within the iStan’s device firmware and presumably required for the proper functioning of the device which makes it impossible to disable without re-engineering. Additionally because the iStan has its own built-in wireless access point, users are unable to implement traditional network security controls such as firewalls. The best mitigation in this case may be to keep attackers from getting within radio range of the device’s wireless access point. Reception areas, physical access and identity management, and alarms and sensors may be the most appropriate controls to secure building interiors and therefore the computing devices within (Campbell, 2016).</p>

										<p>In addition to the WPS vulnerability, Glisson et. al. used a tool called MDK3 to demonstrate that the iStan is susceptible to denial of service attacks. MDK3 was designed to perform stress tests and penetration tests against wireless networks (Sankar, 2018). Wireless denial of service attacks are extremely difficult to prevent, and as a result the best mitigation may be to deploy a wireless intrusion detection system (TechTarget, 2009). A wireless intrusion detection system should be able to detect wireless denial of service attacks and alert cybersecurity teams who can then investigate, locate, and eradicate the threat.</p>

									<h2>Team Assignment</h2>

<p>For this module, I was assigned as part of Group 1. We were allocated an e-commerce website (https://loadedwithstuff.co.uk/) for our group assignment.</p>
									<div class="box">
										<h3>Team Contract</h3>	

										
											<p>Name: Team LWS</p>


												<p>GOALS: What are our team goals for this project? 
										What do we want to accomplish? What skills do we want to develop or refine?
										Goal:
										Completing required assignments as a team.</p>
										
										<p>Skills we want to develop/refine:
										Project management skills:
										Define the project scope to avoid scope creep.
										Stakeholder management - identify all parties involved, and their interest in the project.
										Learning how to apply STRIDE and DREAD methods in practice.
										Information security risk identification and management.
										Team work, including learning to buy into someone else's idea even if it wasn’t one's personal preference.
										Time management and planning skills when working with other people on the project.
									</p>
										
										<p>EXPECTATIONS: What do we expect of one another in regard to attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, the quality of work, etc.?</p>
										
										<p>All members to participate fully in discussions, group assignments and group chats.
										Full attendance at meetings; notifying group members if you cannot attend or will be late.
										Work collaboratively as a team, listening and respecting each other’s ideas.
										Everyone is given an opportunity to contribute, use their experience, skills and ideas throughout the project. No idea/thought is silly and everyone is encouraged to express theirs.</p>
										
										
										<p>POLICIES & PROCEDURES: What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations, such as preparatory tasks, generating ideas, evaluating outcomes? 
										On the first day of each unit team deadlines (both individual team members and overall team ones) are agreed if applicable and documented in a group roadmap document. Where it makes sense, deadlines for future unit work are agreed upon in advance.
										Checklists are created for each assignment related tasks and responsible team members are assigned. Deadlines are specified for each task.
										Weekend before the assignment is due a team meeting is held to finalise the work.
										Everyone must contribute at each stage of the project/assignment. This includes sharing thoughts in group chats, adding research notes to shared group files, etc.
										Team members requiring help on their assigned task must be able to ask for it from their team. This should not be used to score the team member’s performance down in the Peer Assessment.
										Meetings will only be scheduled at times which are between 9am and 9pm local time for each participant.</p>
										
										
										<p>ROLES: Which roles do we need in this project and how do we allocate them? Will there be a project lead?  Is there a need to rotate roles?
										Group leader/facilitator - [Names redacted] (to schedule meetings, update the meeting minutes if applicable, keep an eye on deadlines, track the tasks to completion, do group submissions)</p>
										
										<p>The rest of the group roles will remain flexible and will be addressed on per task/project basis.</p>
										
										
										<p>CONSEQUENCES: How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?  How do we resolve disagreements?
										
										Non-contributing team members will be highlighted in the peer assessment form.
										
										Least contributing team members will be given an opportunity to pick up extra tasks to avoid being scored down on the peer assessment form.
										
										Disagreements on the assignment approach and implementation will be put to vote among the team members. The option with most votes will be the one applied and each team member will be expected to buy into it.</p>
																	
										
										
										<p>By signing this contract, we confirm that:
										we have participated in formulating these goals, expectations, roles, procedures, and consequences as stated in this contact.
										we agree to abide by the contents of this contract

										[Names redacted]

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									<p>First week, and it was announced that this module we would be working in groups. This is both exciting and scary.
										It is exciting because I really do enjoy working with others, 
										especially people from different backgrounds and parts of the world. It is always beneficial to learn from others’ experiences.</p>
									<p>However it is always a bit scary as well because I am aware that I have some personality traits that can cause conflicts in group work.
										At the risk of sounding as though I am making excuses for myself, like many transgender people I was the target of what felt like 
										relentless bullying in public and high school. That experience led me to develop a set of defense mechanisms, most of which have proven 
										unhelpful as an adult. Particularly bothersome for me is a tendency towards - for lack of a better term - “know-it-all-ism”; a need to appear
										smarter than others. It comes from a place of deep insecurity from what I went through as a bullied, queer child and teenager. 
										It caused problems for me the last time I was in an academic group setting, about ten years ago while doing management studies at
										Western University. I will need to continually check myself for this type of behavior.</p>
									<p>Beyond that disclaimer, though, I am looking forward to the module. Our group was provided with no time to waste, and we had only a few
										days to agree on communication channels and get a team contract written and signed. We settled on Google Docs and Zoom to collaborate, 
										and were able to get the contract finished on time.</p>
									<p>We also had to jump right in to a collaborative discussion, reviewing a research paper on attacks against a medical mannequin. This is the
										kind of work that I enjoy most. Wireless attacks are not something that I get a lot of opportunity to research. I found it very
										interesting to work through the paper and do research on the attacks as well as assessing the possibilities for mitigations.</p>
