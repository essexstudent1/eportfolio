										<h3>Network and Information Security Management Final Reflections</h3>


<p>In the first week, it was announced that for this module we would be working in groups. This was both 
exciting and scary. It was exciting because I really do enjoy working with others, especially people
 from different backgrounds and parts of the world. However group work is always a bit scary as well 
 because I am aware that I have some personality traits that can cause conflicts in group work. Particularly 
 bothersome for me is a tendency towards what I call “know-it-all-ism”; a compulsive need to appear smarter
  than others. It comes from a place of deep insecurity from what I went through as a bullied, queer child
   and teenager. It caused conflicts for me the last time I was in an academic group setting, about ten years
    ago while doing management studies at Western University. I realized that I would need to continually
     check myself for this type of behavior.</p>

<p>Throughout this module, we engaged in some very interesting collaborative discussions.  First was reviewing 
a research paper on attacks against a medical mannequin. This is the kind of work that I enjoy most. Wireless
 attacks are not something that I get a lot of opportunity to research. I found it very interesting to work 
 through the paper and do research on the attacks as well as assessing the possibilities for mitigations. </p>

<p>The second collaborative discussion was also interesting, involving preliminary reconnaissance and scanning 
of the target website for our group assignment. However it was also my first big challenge for keeping my 
emotional issues under control, which I failed when making my summary post in unit 6. I stand by the premise
 of my summary post, that cyber attackers often employ stealth and redirection in order to obfuscate their 
 origins and hide their tracks, and therefore cybersecurity professionals need to approach problems with 
 critical thinking, and need to understand when cognitive biases are getting in their way. Unfortunately I 
 did not do a good job of communicating these thoughts. What came out seemed condescending when I re-read it
  the next day, and I felt the need to apologize to my classmates for it. </p>

<p>Things did improve with the third collaborative discussion, which required reviewing case studies from GDPR 
findings. Researching a real world case study and applying learned knowledge to it is very satisfying, although
 I did rather wish that the case studies were a bit more technical. My case study, for instance, involved a
  private investigator simply calling up her nephews and friends in the government and police and asking 
  for favours. Even still, it was a good way to think about how security controls can interact with real 
  world privacy breaches, and some of the other case studies were fascinating. We additionally did further 
  case studies as part of a seminar preparation exercise, and in that assignment I selected the 2016 breach 
  at MySpace. Overall I'd be happy to see more case study assignments in future modules. </p>

<p>Of course, the big assignments for this module were the design document and executive summary report related 
to the security and compliance of the website assigned to our group. We met every Sunday on Zoom for working 
sessions, and collaborated extensively on the assignments in Google Docs. Throughout our work, I tried to 
accomplish a few important things. First, because I had the most work experience of the group, I wanted to
 do my best to ensure the group benefited from that experience, without sounding like a “know-it-all”. I
  tried to do this by suggesting different perspectives or alternate paths to look for answers, rather than 
  just proffering opinions. I volunteered to take on the more advanced scanning tools or vulnerabilities to 
  allow my group mates to better succeed. </p>

<p>I also did my best to help out with the overall presentation and writing style of our assignments. I found 
that many of my group mates tended to write in a style that was either very academic or very technical. I
 felt that the assignments would be better presented more like business documents, and so I spent a lot of
  time organizing the information and proposing text edits to give it a more business-centric look and feel. 
  I like to think that my contributions improved our results.</p>

<p>The hardest part of these assignments was completing the peer reviews. For the design document, I was a bit
 disappointed that some of the team members were not contributing as much as the rest. For instance, we had 
 all agreed that we would each contribute three vulnerabilities to the report and would then pare them down
  based on the word count. That should have given us 15 vulnerabilities to work with but when we went to 
  finalize the document we only had 10, meaning that at least one person had not contributed any data. 
  Fortunately it seemed that things improved for the executive summary assignment and everyone in the group 
  made good contributions.</p>

<p>In addition to my other contributions to the group assignments, I ended up being the face of the group 
during the module seminars. The timing of the live seminars worked out well for me, as they occurred at 9am 
my local time and I rarely have work meetings that early, only missing one seminar. The opposite was true 
for the rest of my group. We were expected to do some sort of group presentation at most of the seminars, 
so this task fell to me by default most days. On the few times that others from my group attended the seminar,
 I did try to encourage them to do the presentation but they declined each time. I do presentations all the
  time for work so I did not mind but I felt that by declining, my group mates were passing up an opportunity 
  to grow a valuable skill.</p>

<p>Overall I did enjoy this module. Much of the material that we covered was a refresher for me, but a lot of 
that was a very welcome refresher. It has been a long time since I got to do highly technical work, so I 
appreciated getting to re-learn how to use a variety of scanning tools. We also did cover a fair bit of more
 modern topics around the future of the Internet, which was all new to me and very interesting.
