										<h3>Group 1: Opening argument 3</h3>


<p>The current host-centric Internet architecture was not designed for security, leaving it susceptible to many 
different types of attacks (My-course.co.uk, 2020). </p>

<p>Content-centric networking (CCN) architectures, such as named data networking (NDN) and content aware 
searching retrieval and stream (COAST), include security in their design, addressing many of the attack 
vectors which threaten host-centric networking (Ding, W. et. al., 2016). Security improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CCN largely eliminates the problem of distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, which targets hosts rather than data (Bilal, M. et. al., 2020).</li>

<li>CCN architectures incorporate security into their design, providing improved confidentiality and integrity controls around data using concepts including secure distribution of protected content (SDPC) (Ding, W. et. al., 2016).</li>

<li>Some CCN architectures, including COAST, allow for intelligent overlays which can monitor for suspicious content requests (Ding, W. et. al., 2016).</li></ul>

<p>By solving some of the most vexatious security problems, content-centric networking is the future of the Internet.</p>

									<h2>Development Team Project: Executive Summary</h2>

<p>The next assessment in this module is an executive summary of the completed evaluation based on the design document your team developed in Unit 6. Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the criteria grid (Module Resources).</p>

                  
									<div class="box">
										
										<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Loaded With Stuff! (loadedwithstuff.co.uk) is an e-commerce site targeting customers looking for the newest
 technology from known brands. In an earlier design document, the authors identified the regulatory bodies 
 applicable to the website and reviewed a list of relevant theoretical security vulnerabilities.</p>
 
<p>In this executive summary, the authors provide an overview of the confirmed theoretical vulnerabilities 
as well as newly discovered ones applicable to LoadedWithStuff! website, and identifies mitigation
 recommendations ordered by business priority which address applicable regulations identified in the
  Design document.</p>
  
<h3>Scanning Methodology</h3>

<p>The list of vulnerabilities identified in the design document is not considered all encompassing, thus,
 to ensure all critical web vulnerabilities have been addressed in this executive report, the OWASP Top 
 10 (2021) was employed as a framework for performing vulnerability scans. The OWASP recommendations target
  the most critical exposures and are well documented and used within the industry (Fredj et al, 2021). </p>
  
<p>By using the OWASP Top 10, a standard security baseline is developed. It ensures the presence of critical
 security configurations and minimises risk by providing required technical and administrative controls that
  are implemented as required due diligence, in a proactive approach (Jenkins,2022). The OWASP top 10 
  provides any business with value through following the processes illustrated in our methodology in Figure 1 
  (RedScan Teams, 2020).</p>

<h3>Scanning Tools</h3>

<p>The details of vulnerability scanners used to confirm the presence of the exposures discussed in the
 previous design document and to discover any new ones are summarised in Table 1.</p>
 
 
 
<table><tr><th>Vulnerability scanner</th>

<th>Description/Justification of use</th>

<th>The scope of the scan</th></tr>

<tr><td>Open Web Application Security project Zed Attack Proxy (OWASP ZAP)</td>

<td>OWASP ZAP is an open source, well known application used to inspect web application security
 loopholes (Sandhya et al, 2017).</td>
 
<td>An automated scan was run which maps out the website and its pages, records all requests and
 responses sent to the pages mapped and creates an alert if there is a potential issue (Zap, 2022).</td></tr>
 
 
<tr><td>Burp Suite Community Edition</td>

<td>A popular vulnerability detection tool used for penetration testing by auditors, researchers and pen 
testers (Kim, 2020).</td>

<td>Burp proxy was used to intercept the traffic between the user and the website and the ‘Request in browser’
 functionality was used for manual access control issues testing (PortSwigger, 2022).</td></tr>
 
<tr><td>Kali Linux</td>

<td>Kali Linux is an open source operating system. It contains more than 600 different tools targeting
 different cyber security tasks which makes it a very versatile application (Čisar, 2018).</td>
 
<td>A number of Kali Linux utilities were employed as part of the scanning. These included:

<ul><li>See-SURF for identifying potential Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities (GeeksforGeeks, 2022).</li>
<li>Sslscan, used to determine any cryptographic issues (Kali, 2022).</li>
<li>Nikto, a vulnerability scanner, used for the detection of various weaknesses (Bintahin, 2021).</li></ul></td></tr>



<tr><td>Wappalyzer</td>

<td>A browser extension which identifies the technologies and components used to create a website (wappalyzer, 2022).</td>

<td>The application submits one or more HTTP requests to the website being targeted and searches for a fingerprint 
used to identify the application used and version number (Nugroho et al, 2021). </td></tr>


<tr><td>Nmap</td>

<td>An open source network security auditing tool used to determine various network and host characteristics
 (Arun & Bijimol, 2021).</td>
 
<td>Nmap was employed to scan the target for open ports (Messier, 2018).</td></tr>

<tr><td>Nessus</td>

<td>A popular and flexible security scanner able to perform more than 1200 different checks on any given website
(Ariyani & Wijaya, 2017).</td>

<td>Nessus was employed to scan all valid ports, and to perform server OS and version detection (Obbayi, 2019).</td></tr>


<tr><td>HostedScan security</td>

<td>Performs OWASP Zap full web scan provided by the HostedScan Security detects front-end and API 
vulnerabilities (HostedScan, 2022).</td>

<td>Please refer to the OWASP ZAP entry in this table for the details.</td></tr>


<tr><td>Pentest Tools: SQL injection scanner</td>

<td>The SQL injection scanner is a free online tool which scans for SQL injection vulnerabilities (Pentest Tools, 2022).</td>

<td>The scanner crawls the website and performs a deep inspection on the web page and its parameters looking for
 SQL injection weaknesses (Pentest Tools, 2022).</td>

Figure 1: Vulnerability scanners used, descriptions and the scope of scans performed.</tr>
</table>


<h3>Limitations of Scanning Activities</h3>

<p>The hosting provider for the target website, A2 Web Hosting, has implemented a number of security controls
 for their clients (A2hosting.com, 2022):</p>
 
<ul><li>Distributed Denial of Service Protection</li>
<li>Dual Web Hosting Firewalls</li>
<li>Brute Force Defence</li>
<li>Virus Scanning</li>
<li>Server Hardening</li>
<li>Security Monitoring</li></ul>

<p>These controls often interfered with the scanning activities undertaken for this report by generating error 
messages and CAPTCHA challenges, as shown in Image 1. Access to the site was sometimes blocked too, causing
 scanning to abort. In order to avoid permanent blocks, tests were carried out using various virtual private
  network (VPN) services.</p>
  
<p>We could also not confirm the vulnerabilities introduced by improper log configurations or insecure website 
design (OWASP TOP 10 2021 categories 4 and 9); this would require additional access to the page’s Admin panel, 
its code and database. This is out of scope for this executive summary, however, it should be considered when
 conducting any future assessments as an improvement.</p>


<p>Figure 2: Imunify360 WAF interfering with a scan.</p>






<h3>Results of Scanning Activities</h3>

<p>The scans performed using tools in Table 1 detected various high, medium, low risks. However, this section 
focuses on the weaknesses with the highest likelihood as per OWASP Top 10 and risks from the Design document 
to determine the loadedwithstuff.co.uk attack surface. An example of different risk level alerts detected
 by OWASP ZAP and HostedScan Security can be seen in Figure 3. The scope of scan of the two tools and difference 
 in versions is responsible for the difference in the results.</p>

<p>Figure 3: The number of alert instances reported by OWASP ZAP and HostedScan Security by risk level.</p>




<p>Figure 4: Number of vulnerabilities discovered for each DREAD risk level ranking.</p>





<p>A shortlist of discovered security exposures (new and previously identified) in Table 2 have been ranked 
using the DREAD risk ranking methodology (University of Essex Online, 2022), where 0 is no risk and 3 is 
high risk. The risk ranking will be used for deriving the recommendations’ business priority. Figure 4
 visualises the number of vulnerabilities against each DREAD risk level.</p>

<p>Automated scans identified no significant misconfigurations in the system. While Nmap reported thousands of open ports, Nessus suggested that these are false positives. This may indicate that the server is protected by a Tarpit or similar defence. Tarpit systems slow down and confuse attackers, by responding to requests on any port number (Dalke,  2014).</p>
<p>However, manual testing with Netcat has shown that the server does have some open ports, including File Transfer Protocol (FTP). FTP is considered an insecure protocol as it does not encrypt the login credentials nor the data being transferred (Helpsystems.com, 2020).</p></td></tr>

<p>Table 3: List of recommendations ordered by business priority.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The list of recommendations in Table 3 address a variety of currently relevant web application vulnerabilities;
 it would counter the most common weaknesses and strengthen the security of the website. However, readers
  should be aware that no web application can ever be 100% secure (Vigliarolo, 2018), and this list is by no
   means exhaustive. There may be additional vulnerabilities that could not be detected due to missing
    accesses to the admin page, code and database or where the detection has been prevented by the A2 Web
     Hosting security controls.</p>
     
<p>To further strengthen an e-commerce website, ISO 21001 recommends performing vulnerability scans on
 a quarterly basis for early threat detection (Stankovic, 2021). The vulnerability scanning framework
  could also be expanded to look for other common vulnerabilities such as those listed in the National
   Vulnerability Database (NVD) (Sane, 2020) in addition to the OWASP Top 10. The use of penetration
    testing should also be considered to detect threats not picked up by the automated scanners. </p>
    
<p>It is also suggested that anyone handling the website should receive Cyber Security training whilst the 
organisation should consider implementing a Cyber Security framework to streamline the approach to security
 threats (Nidecki, 2022).</p>
