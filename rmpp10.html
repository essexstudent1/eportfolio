										<p>Welcome.</p>

<p>My name is Kate Wood. I am a student in the MSc Cyber Security program at the University of Essex Online. This is my research proposal presentation for the module Research Methods and Professional Practice, January 2023.</p>

<p>The title of my proposed research project is “A chatbot system for reducing anti-LGBTQ+ cyberbullying on social networking sites”.</p>


<p>In this presentation, I take you through an introduction, present the research problem, review the proposed approach, and provide a project plan.</p>

<p>Cyberbullying refers to the use of digital technologies, such as the Internet or mobile phones and other devices, to harm or harass others (Aboujaoude et al., 2015). </p>

<p>Cyberbullying can encompass many different types of activities, such as sending threatening messages; posting embarrassing content online such as nude images of the victim; impersonation, for instance by setting up a fake account in the name of the victim and using it to post incriminating content; outing, by posting private information on the victim related to sexual or gender diversity; and doxxing, which refers to sharing personal information about a victim such as their full real name, location, and school or place of employment (Smith & Steffgen, 2013).</p>

<p>Cyberbullying is a pervasive and growing problem which disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable youth populations.</p>

<p>The most recent data available from the USA indicates that approximately 23 percent of teens aged 13 to 17 reported having been the victim of a recent cyberbullying incident. These numbers go up significantly for LGBTQ+ youth. 35 percent of transgender youth reported victimisation, while 32 percent of teens who identify as other than hetrosexual reported being a victim (Hinduja, 2021).</p>


<p>Cyberbullying can have serious mental and physical health impacts on victims. The most common impacts include anxiety and depression, which in some cases can last for years. Victims often become socially isolated and withdrawn, resulting in poor academic performance. In more extreme cases, impacts can include drug and alcohol addiction, self-harm, and suicide ideation (Hamm et al., 2015).</p>

<p>Impacts tend to be even more damaging for LGBTQ+ youth, who are four times more likely to experience severe cyberbullying than non-LGBTQ+ youth. They additionally often lack strong social support systems, making them less resilient to cyberbullying incidents (Elipe et al., 2018).</p>


<p>A key finding in the research into cyberbullying relates to the role of bystanders, those individuals who are neither the bully nor the victim but rather observe the exchange of messages during a cyberbullying incident.</p>

<p>Bystanders can be passive or active. A recent survey found that over 55 percent of bystanders to incidents were passive, meaning that they observed the incident but did not intervene one way or another.</p>

<p>Active bystanders are those who choose to become involved in the incident, either by supporting the victim or helping the bully. The survey found that approximately 35 percent of bystanders reported that they directly supported the victim.</p>

<p>The role of bystanders in a cyberbullying incident can be significant. Positive or negative interventions can either mitigate or aggravate the severity and related impacts of the incident (Olenik-Shem111esh et al., 2017).</p>



<p>Given the prevalence and the serious nature of the impacts of cyberbullying, especially on the most vulnerable youth populations, finding new and effective ways to reduce cyberbullying is an important goal.</p>

<p>There have been many efforts to combat cyberbullying using traditional methods. These include school-based intervention programs, monitoring of online activities by parents or educators, and restrictions on screen time for youth. However, as explored in the previous literature review, these often have mixed results. Even when they are effective, they require significant investments of time and resources (Slonje et al., 2013).</p>

<p>In the face of this challenge, cyber security tools and practices have emerged as a potential means to combat cyberbullying. To that end, a considerable amount of progress has been made in utilising deep learning systems to detect cyberbullying (Arif, 2021). However, there is a significant gap in the existing research related to responding to a cyberbullying incident once it is detected.</p>

<p>Chatbots have emerged as a promising tool in the field of cyber security, with the potential to automate many tasks and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of security measures. However, there is currently little research on the use of chatbots to combat cyberbullying specifically.</p>

<p>This project seeks to investigate the use of chatbots as a tool for combating cyberbullying on social networking sites. By exploring the feasibility and effectiveness of chatbots for this purpose, this project has the potential to expand our understanding of how chatbots can be used in the context of cyber security.</p>

<p>In doing so, the project has the potential to provide insights into the design and implementation of chatbot systems more generally, including best practices for creating chatbots that are effective at interacting with users in the role of an active bystander in sensitive contexts. The project may additionally further our understanding of the importance of bystanders on social networking sites during cyberbullying incidents.</p>

<p>Finally, this project may identify ethical and privacy considerations which must be addressed when deploying chatbots on social networking sites, especially when interacting with vulnerable populations.</p>


<p>The research question posed by this project is “How effective are chatbots at detecting and responding to instances of cyberbullying in real time on social networking sites?”</p>

<p>This research question will allow for the investigation of the potential of chatbots for combating anti-LGBTQ+ cyberbullying, as well as exploring the specific design factors that contribute to their effectiveness in this cyber security context.</p>

<p>Two hypotheses are proposed to help focus the research question.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 1 is that chatbots designed to detect and respond to instances of cyberbullying on social networking sites will be effective at identifying and mitigating these attacks, resulting in a reduction in the prevalence and severity of cyberbullying on these platforms.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 2 is that the design of cyber security chatbot systems for combating cyberbullying on social networking sites will be a critical factor in their effectiveness. Specifically, chatbots that act as active, positive bystanders will be more effective at mitigating instances of cyberbullying than those that are not.</p>

<p>The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate a cyber security chatbot system for detecting and responding to instances of anti-LGBTQ+ cyberbullying on social networking sites.</p>

<p>The objectives of the project are as follows:</p>

<p>One - identify and document the requirements for the chatbot.</p>

<p>Two - develop a chatbot system capable of detecting instances of cyberbullying on social networking sites.</p>

<p>Three - enhance the chatbot system to respond to instances of cyberbullying on social networking sites.</p>

<p>Four - conduct user surveys and interviews to explore users' perceptions of the chatbot system for combating cyberbullying, and to identify key design factors that contribute to user engagement and perceptions of effectiveness.</p>

<p>Five - analyse the data collected through the above methods to identify key design factors that contribute to the effectiveness of chatbot systems for detecting and mitigating cyberbullying, and to develop recommendations for the design of future chatbot systems in this context.</p>

<p>And six - write a final report.</p>


<p>The previous literature review for this topic found two recent papers which are directly relevant to anti-cyberbullying chatbots. The first was a paper from Gabrielli et al. (2020) which studied the effectiveness of a chatbot for intervention. The second was from Ueda et al. (2021) which proposed a method for hijacking user accounts in a chatroom as a means to simulate bystander intervention. </p>

<p>A further paper from Vijayakumar and Hari Prasad (2021) proposed a method for developing a chatbot intervention system, but stopped short of building and deploying it.</p>

<p>Finally, Ige and Adewale (2022) built a chatbot system which could detect and block cyberbullying. However as a result of their design decisions, they were unable to test it in a live environment.</p>

<p>While there is current and ongoing research in this area, to date there remains a significant gap between theory and practice with no studies to test an anti-cyberbullying chatbot in a live setting. This project will build on existing research by evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of a chatbot on a live social networking site.</p>




<p>This project will require the use of several different methodologies.</p>

<p>The overall development of the chatbot will use an agile methodology. This will enable the project to leverage a rapid, iterative cycle towards building key features (Brush and Silverthorne, 2022).</p>

<p>The cyberbullying detection engine will be built using a supervised machine learning method. This will allow for an approach that builds on the methods and best practices developed in existing research papers (Alloghan et al., 2019). </p>

<p>The intervention engine will leverage an existing large language model system such as GPT-3, accessed via web API. A large language model will provide the chatbot with a set of capabilities that will be required for successful cyberbullying intervention (Tamkin et al., 2021).</p>

<p>While the primary focus will be on the development and deployment of the chatbot system, the project will additionally need to collect some preliminary data related to its effectiveness as an intervention mechanism. </p>

<p>The target social networking site for this project is Reddit. Reddit was selected as it has several features which make it favourable. It is a very popular site, with 430 million active users in 2020 (Business of Apps, 2023). Additionally, it has conducive user policies including the freedom of anonymity as well as permitting the use of chatbots (Redditinc.com, 2023).</p>

<p>For evaluation purposes, the project will enlist a small number of volunteer participants on Reddit. This will be done by posting notices on a selection of LGBTQ+-related forums, or subreddits as they are called on the site. 	</p>

<p>Evaluation of the effectiveness of the system will employ a structured interview method using pre-set questions in order to collect a consistent data set across interviews (Dawson, 2015).</p>




<p>This project presents a number of ethical considerations which must be addressed. These relate to both the behaviour of the chatbot and the management of research participants.</p>

<p>Any collection of data will be done in accordance with Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act as well as the European General Data Protection Regulation. The chatbot will only have access to publicly available data as exposed by the Reddit API, and will not permanently store any collected data.</p>

<p>Caution will be exercised in relation to the interventions provided by the chatbot. Large language models such as GPT-3 can and do learn biases, including biases related to sexual orientation and gender identity (Tamkin et al., 2021). The project will need to carefully monitor messages generated by the chatbot to ensure that they are appropriate given the sensitive context.</p>

<p>Finally, because LGBTQ+ people are a vulnerable population, ethical standards will need to be carefully adhered to for the management of research participants. For instance, requiring parental consent for research involving minors can result in outing the potential participants, leading to unintended harm. To address this concern, the project will only seek to recruit participants who are 18 years of age or older. Overall, the project will adopt and apply the ethical standards for research involving lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations proposed by Meezan and Martin (2009).</p>




<p>This project will produce a cyber security software application. The purpose of the software will be to act as a chatbot designed to detect and respond to cyberbullying incidents on a social networking site. A README file will be developed to provide instructions on how to build and run the application.</p>

<p>The source code for the project will be hosted on GitHub. </p>

<p>In addition to the application, this project will prepare a report. The report will provide details of the software design, as well as results of the evaluation and recommendations for future research.</p>

 


<p>The project timeline is proposed to be 30 weeks.</p>

<p>Software development will involve requirements gathering and design, development, detection model training, and deployment and testing.</p>

<p>Running in parallel will be tasks associated with the research participants, including developing a plan and recruiting participants.</p>

<p>The final steps will include carrying out the evaluation assessment interviews with the participants, analysing the resultant data, and writing the final report.</p>




<p>This concludes my research project proposal.  </p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>This was a tough week asI struggled to get my proposal presentation as well as the statistical spreadsheets done on time. I actually enjoyed the work of putting the proposal together. It certainly helped me pull together a lot of my thoughts on the purpose and approach for my capstone project. At the same time, it made me realize just how much work needs to go into a project at this academic level, and I have again found myself thinking that I am potentially biting off far more than I can chew (which is, by the way, a rather gross phrase if you start to think about it). It is certainly important to consider the effort requirements, though, as I will need to start scoping the real project soon.</p>
										
									<p>In addition to the summative assignment, we also had to submit a mandatory formative assignment in the form of a set of statistical spreadsheets. I was not expecting this. I have always struggled mightily with math. To this day, I have no idea why, because I am a very analytical person which should make me inclined towards numbers. I don’t hate math; I’m just simply not good at it, and it is not for lack of trying. As a young girl, I wanted to go to university for computer science but I just couldn’t do the advanced math courses that were a requirement. For whatever reason, my brain seems wired in such a way that it makes it impossible for me to arrive at a place of comprehension when faced with anything more complicated than A=2+2.</p>
									
									<p>So you can imagine how I felt with being given a set of statistical worksheets to do. Two tailed t-test of hypothesis for the mean? I read the textbook in an attempt to understand this, but it may as well have been written in another language. I tried my best, but I am under no impression that my best is very good. I can only hope to avoid needing math in my capstone project.</p>
