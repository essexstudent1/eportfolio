                  <ul><li>Review what is meant by risk within the context of Information Security Management.</li>
<li>Discuss how to gather, analyse and mitigate risks from a security audit/ review/ planning session.</li>
                    <li>Review business continuity and disaster recovery standards.</li>
                    <li>Explore industry specific security standards and directives.</li>

									<h2>E-Portfolio Activity</h2>
									<p>Based on your evaluation in the previous session and the articles above, consider the recommendation given above:</p>

<ul><li>What are the pros and cons of using Kali Linux vs. Nessus?</li>
<li>Has this changed your original evaluation score?</li></ul>
<p>Discuss your answers within your team and then record your answers and team discussions in your e-portfolio.</p>

                    <blockquote>The articles give suggestions on different ways Kali Linux can be used too. For example, you could download a ready to use Debian based Kali Linux and set it up as a virtual machine, or you could create a Debian based virtual machine and install Kali Linux tools on it as you need it.</blockquote>
<p>You can also get a "Live" distro. Essentially you make a bootable USB drive with Kali (or other distro) on it. Your computer can then boot using the USB drive instead of your hard drive, and will load up the OS on the USB drive.</p>
										<blockquote>I think the main issue for me would be my lack of knowledge of Linux OS and learning the commands you must use for each security tool. Also, learning to understand what each scan result means.</blockquote>
<p>It is possible to bring down the target system. In my very first job as a security analyst for a small bank, I ran a simple port scan on our backup banking system, which was this big HP-UX server. Unbeknownst to anyone, HP-UX had a denial of service vulnerability at the time where connections to a specific port number caused the entire OS to become unresponsive. It was a really good thing that I was testing the backup server rather than production.</p>

	<p>The other big potential issue is getting banned by your ISP for suspected hacking.</p>
                    <blockquote>I think the criteria such as Powerful, is very subjective. For example, the SQL map may not be a very versatile tool, but it does a great job at automatic SQL injection testing, and so, when it comes to these types of attacks, should it not be rather flagged as powerful?
</blockquote>
                    <p>I don't mind the criteria, but the rating system of binary Yes or No is too simple imo.</p>

								<h2>Reflections</h2>
									<div class="box">
									
									<p>After the rush of getting our design document assignment completed, this was a mercifully light week. The
lecturecast was all about risk management and compliance, which I have lived and breathed for years now.
We did have a bit of a team assignment where we read some additional material on Kali Linux and Nessus, and
were to discuss whether to update our previous team scores based on the new information. However after 
submitting our big assignment, nobody had much energy to do a lot of work on this request.</p>

<h4>Technical Challenges Update</h4>

<p>I made some further progress on solving my citation challenges. I had given up on "CiteThisForMe" as it only
partially helped and still required a good bit of manual work. I tried a few other citation extensions for
Chrome, most of which were entirely useless. However I finally think I have found a workable extension with

the citation. </p>
